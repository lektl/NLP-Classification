Any advice so appreciated thanks!!!

I graduated college May and work as a reporter since mid-June which I got my degree in. Still have lease for Apt I am paying for in college town which I am not using since job is in hometown.

I am a reporter/ journalist have talked to many in the industry and they say my workload is a lot, even the experienced people do. At a completing media organization, an employee I know with similar experience is responsible for 1/2 the articles per week and doesn’t need to post his articles or do some other duties I do.

I can’t afford two apts on basically minimum wage so I’m living with parents as I have my Apt in college town I’m paying for. My mental health has been very bad lately which is my problem to solve. I am in the process of switching healthcare providers as can no longer use my college doctors I used year round for years since graduated. However, my dad controls my access to medication sometimes says I do not need psychiatric meds when I do. But I need to take them to work.

Was having difficult time Fri/ Mon/ Tues and didn’t get much done while working remotely. My job is hybrid so I’m in the office sometimes other times no, the remote work wasn’t issue was mental health.

So now I am trying to get help but having setbacks. For example, was feeling better yesterday but I still slipped up on something and I feel horrible I missed it since someone complained.

I need to work here at least until I get the title to my dads car because he is very controlling but used cars are so expensive.

I keep thinking to myself I wish I jumped off a bridge this weekend and didn’t call my boyfriend who stopped me. I know I haven’t been working this job long but wish I could have taken full week off or a few days to set up medical care and and come back stronger instead of feeling I can take no time off due to how short staffed company is.

Just kind of a think out loud and maybe some kinship.

My mood stabilizers take away the mania and some of the depressive episodes and my required sleeping pills put me to sleep on a regular basis (because not going to bed for a few days on a constant cycle is bad for you I guess).  But I feel like what used to be a net zero for my mood has now just been left as a net negative.  I felt amazing during mania (I was lucky that my manic episodes weren’t seriously dangerous) and they balanced out the depressive episodes.  I used to be be awesome during my manic episodes.  I was more social, more active, and even though doing chores would end in crying (because I ran out of chores to do and the compulsive need wasn’t able to be satisfied) I still got them done and compulsively kept my apartment spotless.  Hell, I once joined a frat and 5 clubs in a single day and by the time episode ended, I was on the social committee for the frat.  (FYI, I’m not into Greek life, which is why I didn’t join when I started college).  I met and got dates with 2 of my last 4 gfs while manic.

Granted, I also tried to kill myself during one manic episode.

But for all of the outcomes of manic episodes and the emotional crashes that occur afterwards, I’d still call it a net positive.

Now I feel like I’m just left with the depressive episodes that the meds can’t fix and I alternate from being at a balanced mood to being depressed.

Why can’t I lose the depressive episodes and keep some level of the mania?

This is my belief. I HATE being bipolar. I fucking hate it. 

But, I've been through the pharmacutical fuckery and I've been through a lot of therapy. That actually does amount to something. 

Sigh. 

My kid lives between my house and her dad's. Neither is easy. 

But at least here, she has a voice. She, even at 10 years old, is taken seriously. I don't understand my own emotions, especially in reaction to life in general, but ffs I leave her the space to realize that in herself, to understand that emotions are fucking wild and hard, sticky and difficult. 

Her dad's house... I'm gonna talk shit. She is reprimanded and lectured if she disagrees. She calls me for comfort in tears. She knows she is going to be talked at, not discussed with, on anything of emotional importance to her. 

They love her. Of course they do! And I constantly remind her of that. And it's not every day or every week that times are hard for her over there. But by golly, when she's feeling big emotions, they are very clear about how they think she needs to handle it all by ignoring it all. Just accept it as it is and stop whining.

She's a kid. She's 10. They don't seem to realize that we are teaching her about emotions just like everything else. Well, they do, but imo they're teaching her unhealthy ways of dealing with emotions. Sadness? Pfft, be grateful. Anger? Don't want to see even a trace of that. Neglected? Oh, come on, OF COURSE we are here for you, how is that not OBVIOUS? (/S) Acceptance? She can't even *hint* at being nonbinary/gay/whatever she feels like being this week. 

She doesn't tell them ANYTHING. I ALWAYS hear about how bad it is to keep secrets when co-parenting... but she specifically told me not to tell them she's in therapy again. I keep my mouth shut because she's been in therapy for 5 years, with 4 different therapists, and they met ONE,  ONCE. And you know what they spent their time doing???? BITCHING ABOUT HER BEHAVIOR. NOTHING constructive, NOTHING empathetic, NOTHING but complaints about how their SIX year old couldn't regulate her fucking emotions, gee fucking whiz. I blamed myself for her self-destructive outbursts, even though the reason she went to therapy in the first place was because of possible molestationon, which he blew off completely because ""Uncle John has 3 daughters of his own, he's got a prestigious job, he's family."" Jesus H. Christ. The man LOCKED HER BEDROOM DOOR so she could ""show him her favorite dolls."" They even put a fucking chair against the door, too, but ""that was her idea,"" at 5 years old, to ""make sure grandma couldn't come in"" if they got caught because GRANDMA HERSELF SAID THEY WEREN'T ALLOWED DOWNSTAIRS. ""My mom only said that cause she was embarrassed about the mess."" EXCUSE FUCKING ME. 

Can you believe I've blamed myself SO MANY TIMES for my kid's issues when THIS has been the other side of her life for 8 years?! (NOT saying I don't have my part - we're all bipolar here, there's NO DOUBT I've fucked up PLENTY.)

So, yes, I feel terrible for procreating on many levels, but AT LEAST I can be open, welcoming, unconditionally loving to my child. I can't imagine a modern bipolar person not being understanding of their child's emotional issues. I don't ever see it on this board - only the outdated,  previous generation that doesn't acknowledge their OWN issues - THEY end up being the shitty parents. We are all so much BETTER. We've got the TOOLS. WE are raising the most mentally healthy generation ever, I do declare. 

So, fuck all. Her dad would still be her blindly homophobic dad and her step mom would still be her crazy Q-anon step mom, but me with my bipolar - fuck all, I'm a God damn asset to my child considering the cards she's been dealt.

Lil backstory:
My boyfriend (23m) of 6 years was diagnosed with bipolar earlier this year, and him being diagnosed answered a lot of stuff for him in terms of how he feels and sometimes the way he acts, he finally had an understanding once he was diagnosed because it explained a lot for him, in the last year or so was when he noticed something was going on if that makes sense. He is in therapy, but will be branching out I believe to have someone who has criteria to treat and help bipolar disorder because it's out of his therapists hands, like out of their realm if that makes sense. He also takes medicine for his adhd/depression/anxiety but is still looking for medicine to help his bipolar/and ""episodes"" I call it, so he does see his pcp as well.

I am having a hard time trying to be the proper girlfriend for when he is dealing with episodes, or his moods changing, or just his bipolar in general, and because of that I feel like I am failing. It is scary seeing bipolar affect him because I know it's not him when he gets like this (he isn't physical or abusive or anything like that.).

How do I be there for him when he is in a mood that is triggered by his bipolar? He has become a different person (not with actions or anything, just mood and whatnot) and when he gets in these ways it's very scary to me because I'm trying to understand it so I can help him and listen and be there for him, but I don't want to trigger him so there are times I feel like I am walking on eggshells to make sure I don't offset anything because I don't want to ruin the mood, I am also like that with a lot of people as well. I am an overly cautious person who is a worry wart, especially when it comes to my boyfriend. He told me when I over worry or treat him differently or treat him like he's ""crazy"", it affects him, and he's only just told me this now and I feel like I'm failing and not knowing what to actually do. I didn't know I was treating him differently. He told me doesn't even want to open up to me because he's worried I'll freak out with whatever he says because I may take it extremely. But I don't know how to not take anything seriously because all of this is new to me still, I just want to understand better and be the best girlfriend I can be to him so he knows he can turn to me at any time in need and confide and not feel like he's being treated differently? Like I said I didn't know I was treating him differently. I don't want to be overwhelming, I am also a huge empath so when he's down or whatever, it affects me too because I hate seeing him deal with this. I am also someone who is huge on caring, I feel like I care too much sometimes (with anything - I try to make sure everything and everyone is okay).

What do I do to differentiate what extreme behavior is to say... a mood that was triggered by whatever? How do I learn the patterns? I am doing everything I can to keep watch on his patterns, to understand and differentiate basically. He tells me to just listen, and I do, but there are times where I can't help but say something and result of that is what is influencing me to make this post.

Bottom line question is, how do I be there and be the best partner I can be for my boyfriend who has bipolar disorder?

I don’t know what to think or act on at this point.

I received a BD1 diagnosis in 2018 after experiencing a brief psychotic episode. the circumstances of this hospitalization and the ensuing inpatient/outpatient treatment were so isolating and alienating to me that I have very little desire to engage with mental healthcare.

my diagnosis was made on the basis of my singular (frightening beyond words) manic/psychotic episode. psychotic depression was a differential diagnosis, as the themes of my delusions were heavily guilt-themed and martyr-tinged.

I managed to escape (my feeling and perspective) further forced intervention by deciding to comply and be as bland as possible in the process. I went cold turkey after a weeks on an antipsychotic, which was a lot. I felt the BD diagnosis already meant I was perceived in a certain way by the mental healthcare professionals.

I’ve been able to manage in the interim by rigorous attention to diet, exercise, and stress reduction. I do occasionally dip into weeks- and months-long depressions, but I have not experience any major manias or hypomanic experiences, outside of a minor period in 2020.

I’m wondering though, as I am about to pursuing further schooling, is it worth it looking into additional opinions? I worry that something could happen like the trajectory of my first psychotic experience yet again. still, I felt so marginalized by my forced interaction with psychiatry, and something in my bones tells me that inviting this back in my life in a search for answers or potential support when things may become stressful is no panacea. I felt like I was being punished by receiving care. I don’t know if what I experience is even akin to manic or depressive symptoms.

Everything is alright but you I start feeling very depressed out of nowhere. I could have a nice day and I end up being sad, dysphoric and depressed in the evening.

I talked about this with my therapist and he told me it is not due to emotional dysregulation because I also have symptoms like excessive sleep, loss of appetite, headache, brainfog etc. He told me that emotional dysregulation can present like depression is emerging but it usually is mental only. Also it doesn't last as long mostly a few hour and a few days max and is a direct reaction to situations rather than sudden onsets.

And I agree. I have emotional dysregulation due to ADHD and this feels different from the mood swings. It is way more severe and more episodic.

Sometimes I will become suicidal and tearful, hopeless etc. I feel like I am legit going into an episode. But after just a few days I snap back completely like nothing happend. 

I told this to my psychiatrist. He argued that this is BRD (brief recurrent depression) and told me that this often happens to people with bipolar disorder. 

I will have those episodes like once every month. I had no major episode since march. I have been in rapid cycling the past two years tho so maybe it is due to this.

Do you guys also have this problem? If yes what do you do about it? I started to rearch for brief recurrent depression and it happens to be a real thing.

also maybe a TW for like paranoia and stuff cause thats kinda what im going to be talking about (+ guns and shootings) 

ok so i just wanted to rant about the like shitty dreams ive been having. so like just about my whole life ive been paranoid about shootings. not even really guns, my dad is hunter, ive been around them, ive shot them, thats not really the problem. its shootings, im in constant fear that whatever building im in is going to get shot up, someone is going to shoot up my house, my house is going to get broken into, ect. on good days i can control it, i can go months without laying in my bed frozen in fear, just going to sleep with ease. but then all of a sudden im scanning the isles in target to make sure no one looks sketchy, waiting till the sun rises to sleep, things like that. and with all of that i also have these crazy dreams. so whenever i start feeling paranoid weed would actually help. i was an avid avid smoker for like a long time, but recently in the past month or two that completely changed. the first really bad time, i smoked like usual, went to bed everything was fine. i kept waking up though out the night in kind of a haze and i dont think i really realized i was hallucinating until the last time. i wake up, in sleep paralysis , a man standing over my bed. ive had VERY minor visual/auditory hallucinations in the past but nothing too worrisome. but this was a full blown hallucination. (i also realize this wasnt a dream but its LEADING to one i promise). the next night i smoked SAME thing but it was a girl standing over me with a knife. and that time i realized i was in paralysis almost immediately. so i took a month long break hoping it was related to lack of sleep. but last night i hung with a friend and smoked. i dont want  to have to explain the whole dream but basically i was at this camp and i went to get something from my car. it was kind of a school related thing but obviously not a school i was in, there as like other things there. so there was a pretty big parking lot and its in the woods so we are kinda surrounded by trees and it is a dirt driveway. im parked all the way at the enterance to far away from the camp. and there was a like a school bus there which is kinda an important detail. so im almost to my car and at the entrance is a man with an AK. the SECOND the man comes into frame i am lucid. my brain was like awake, so i look over to a bush and book it. as i start running he's yelling shit like ""dont pretened no one is here i see the bus i know there is people to shoot yada yada yada"" so i am hiding in this bush and see him walking towards me, again i am like lucid so i was like girl just close your eyes let him shoot you and it will be over. but then i was like no cause in pervious dreams like this it will either replay until i escape the shooter or i will wake up and be in paralysis and hallucinate him. so tbh i dont even remeber what happened after that but i either ended up back at the cabin away from him or i just woke up.

its so exhausting, especially when i know its all just in my head.

So I feel like I'm in a catch 22 because I have to stay poor to afford my meds (I'm from the US fyi) to qualify for public low income medical assistance. But also IDK if I can work enough right now to get the medical coverage I need. But even if I wanted to try to get enough income for health coverage...I have to wait until 2023 when my most expensive medication (Latuda, $1300 per month uninsured) becomes a generic. And that's just the financial side.

It still (after a little more than a year on meds) totally blows my mind that I'll need to take meds for the rest of my life just to stay relatively sane. And it scares the shit out of me if I ever get into a position where I can't get them.

Looking back at old pictures, the outline of my skull is noticeable in my face, same with my spine through my back. My GP was oddly not really concerned about this growing up, though, as I wasn’t “sickly” in his eyes. 

After trying a few bipolar meds, my weight increased to around 110-120, which helped my self-esteem. But then after being on Zyprexa for over a year, I found myself at 150lbs until being taken off of it about 3 months ago and having it replaced by Seroquel. Plus my weight gain seems to be disproportionately in my stomach, in comparison to the weight seen in my limbs and face, which has really been affecting me.

I know that Seroquel is known for weight gain, like Zyprexa, but within a month and a half of being on Seroquel I’ve lost 15lbs. I have no desire to eat, like I can eat if Im with family or friends and still enjoy food, but Ive gone like 2-3 days in a row without food while not feeling any hunger. Im now 133lbs at 23 years old, and while Im depressed and have found myself eating less when I am, it’s never been this drastic.

At first I thought it could be that maybe the weight I’m losing is a result of getting off Zyprexa, idk maybe Zyprexa is worse in this regard enough to where even Seroquel is making me lose weight? But now this seems way too unhealthy.At the same time, the bloating of my stomach that still remains has me conflicted on what to do. It’s gotten a lil better from the Zyprexa weight, but it still is noticeable.

I'm asking because I have been the most stable I have ever been for around 3 months on a medication regimen that includes lithium, an anticonvulsant and an antipsychotic. I still have minor fluctuations but they're not as extreme as before. 

Before being diagnosed with Bipolar, I had been treated with stimulants for attentional issues and suspected ADHD. They caused me, on 2 separate occasions, a year apart, to become manic or mixed. Psychiatrist thought that I just had an adverse reaction to stimulants. 

After being correctly diagnosed with BP and having episodes become more severe, my attentional issues were x10 worse than base line during mood episodes and not being on the right combo of medications. Since I've become stable, my attention span and cognition has improved greatly, but I'm still experiencing difficulties that impact my schooling and work. My psychiatrist said to give it one more month of doing healthy activities such as exercise, diet and socializing to see if attention issues are still there and are distressing.

I have tried strattera, and it made me feel wired and have sexual side effects. Dexedrine and concerta made me manic prior to BP diagnosis.

So, I was just wondering if anybody has had different reactions to ADHD medications both before and after BP diagnosis and proper stabilization (mainly if the risk of switching into mania changed).

I've tried to condense it as much as possible.

Right so myself and my ex fiance had a difficult year and bit with my bipolar. I was in and out of hospital 4x. He was supportive there for me whilst in hospital, visited when he was allowed. However, the affection of the relationship had started to disappear. He was overly stressed I think and focused more on housework and the dog to distract himself and wind down. I was either very chaotic or depressed. 

I was in hospital December and realised Christmas eve ended up being put back on a section 3 Jan 7th. I got my home leave end of Jan and long story short I never ended up back in hospital even though they wanted me back in. There was a racist on the ward, I didn't feel safe (no need to go into that) so I got to stay at home.  i stopped taking my medication when I got out too, I didn't think I needed it for some reason. Looking back at it I still was really unwell. I then broke up with my partner because I didn't feel loved and in all honesty I can't remember what I said but I don't think it was very nice and it was very sporadic and kind of random. I then agreed to try it again but I had this sense of superiority looking back on it and I thought the world owed me everything and I wasn't treated right. I ended up breaking up with him again, still cant remember fully what I said. 

I then went to my friends boyfriends house with her which was in a different city/county. I met his friend  and we got along and things went from there, mind at this time I was off my meds, dancing around in my own little bubble and I didn't really understand what I was doing. I ended up moving to that city and being with him. He was happy when he noticed I wasn't taking my meds, said they're only poison for the body. I was really missing my ex fiance but I had convinced myself I'd only hurt him more and that he was better off without me. I was doing the right thing.  I was completely in my own little world even though I was with this guy just causing myself more and more problems. Drinking, taking drugs but not all day everyday. 

My ex and I agreed to try it again and then I just ignored him for 3 weeks. He then sent a text message asking if I was okay. I just replies something along the lines of I don't want you to have to get involved. After a few texts he said he needed to block me, understandably. I was fucking him around. The scary part is I don't remember these texts at all, I've only just read them back tonight. I found out I was pregnant and in those 3 weeks I ignored him which I don't even remember intentionally ignoring him, I was sorting out abortion appointments and it was scheduled for the day after he text me asking if I was okay. I didnt want him to have to go through that with me when it wasn't his or his responsibility.

 During this time I also sarted believing everything was a game controlled by the master games people and its all entertainment for them. I found a draft text I sent my friend saying everything is all about opposites, everyone is opposite in life and its all controlled. It's like the film free guy. I was asking the guy I was with about this game he was just shutting me down. I was saying they say I've got bipolar? But then some people get the depot some get tablets it's all just part of the game. I couldnt replay the level to get my ex fiance back because the game controllers were controlling everything. I then just didn't know what to do, I felt lost, angry that I was being controlled. I'd sometimes think everyone was in on the game and other times we were all in a game but I was the only one who knew. Nothing was clear.

Anyhow long story over but I know I've hurt him too much, I just upped and left and he thought i was living a happy splendid life and that I didn't love him anymore. He says the trust Is gone. He still loves me and I'm his soulmate but he's been hurt too bad. He's also found someone he's been dating for a month and what's to see how that goes. 

Everything since Feb until about June is a blur, I don't remember it really at all. It's just all merged into one big foggy memory. I started taking my meds again after some persuasion from a friend and my delusions sort of worked in my favour because I wasn't bothered about the meds because it was all a game anyway. I know it doesn't make much sense I'm trying to understand it myself. I've been on them again since June and everything's just becoming clearer and clearer. I was a complete different person, I was selfish, had a sense of superiority and just didn't give a shit. Which Is the polar opposite of me, I'm a loving caring will help out anyone and worry about other people's needs. It's scared me, it really has.

SO PLEASE TAKE YOUR MEDICATION. you can end up really damaging your life, hurt loved ones and be riddled with guilt like I am. I Lost my soulmate, my stable home we'd built together, my animals, the connection I had with his family.

 People around me are saying I have to try and not feel guilt because it was the illness not me but it was me for stopping medication. I've lost the man I love and the hardest part is I don't remember why I was doing what I was doing or why I felt the way I did. 

If this doesn't fully make sense it's because it's based on what I remember, what I've gathered threw text messages and the notes I was scribbling down at times which aren't always easy to understand.

My boyfriend (28yo like me) has been dealing with serious family stuff, depressive phase of his bipolar disorder and a stressful job. We’ve been dating for 6 months and serious about each other, even discussed kids etc. 

He shut down for a few weeks about 1,5 months ago - he’s going through some serious family stuff plus a stressful job. But he came back even though we didn’t talk for a month (he didn’t reply to anything). I could sense he did try to check in and reply but it was an effort with everything else going on for him

The last several weeks have been alright but he’s been slow at texting generally and struggling - he told me it is not personal so I get that now. We have managed to see each other almost every week or so but it’s not the same as before the depressive phase started in terms of frequency. Anyway now it has been 2.5 weeks since we last saw each other (i was away for a week) but he has ignored my check in text and calls. 

He wants to have a chat soon because he realises this is not sustainable or healthy for us. I told him we need to have a proper convo and not just break up or take an easy way out. At the end of this call, he wanted to came over and we had a very loving, affectionate, fun night.

I’m freaking out because idk how to have this type of convo, this is my first relationship and I really think we can work through our comms issues and my own anxiety is something I am working on too. I also don’t know when we are having this convo but I am hoping to do it soon - he said before my trip 2 weeks ago that we should have it sooner rather than later too.  I got back last week and he has not replied to any of my calls or texts for like 2 weeks now. I’m trying to not spiral but the unknown is hard to face. Bipolar disorder is confusing and complex to navigate and understand as a partner, especially with ghosting tendencies triggering my anxieties. Why do they tend to ghost / disappear ? I am going to give him space because I think he is not doing well and is choosing to be alone / not communicate until ready. 

I am also working on my anxious attachment style triggers because I do love him and want to support him even when he distances himself during tough patches

This is really emotional and a little scary to write, but I'm putting this out there because you know what? I believe this post can do some good. 

Here goes: I am going to apply to medical school in six years. 2028, baby. It's gonna be my year.

I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 2017. I had one major manic episode when I was 13/14, and since then it had been mostly lots of depression with spates of hypomania, leaving Mormonism and pushing myself undiagnosed and unmedicated through college. Made it through after five years of school. Diagnosed as an adult, educated myself on the disorder as an adult, and determined to make myself perfectly compliant with my treatment, because I had too much to lose. It's 2022 now. And I'm not cured. That's not how this disorder works. But I am treated, I am stable, and I have enough faith in my stability, my treatment, my medication, my compliance, myself, and my loved ones that I can start to look to the future, a future I've always, always wanted to pursue: One in medicine.

Unfortunately it's a lot of ""Don't ask don't tell"" when it comes to medicine and mental illness, in the ranks of physicians anyway, so I will be retiring this reddit account in the future. Not now, not tomorrow, but at some point in the future. I'll still be around, just under another name. 

I'm extremely emotional about this right now because this is a dream I have given up on for years. ""I can't do it because I'm gay. Because Obamacare. Because I can't afford it. Because I don't have the time. Because I have too much debt."" But you know what? I've set my affairs in order so that in five years, if I manage my finances smartly, I will have next to no debt by the time 2028 rolls around; I'm comfortable in my sexuality; I'm comfortable with the vagaries of politics and healthcare; I've decided I'm willing to incur the debt to pay for this; and I'm willing and able to invest in the free and semi-paid resources that I have at my disposal to prepare myself for this. Holy fuck.

This can be done. I can do this. And I have so much faith and optimism in the future, I believe that I'm going to succeed.

It's going to be a struggle, and this is going to take years of commitment and preparation before I'm even ready to sit for the MCAT (medical school entrance exam), volunteer time, personal statements, interviews, letters of recommendation, academic coursework, prerequisite coursework completion,... There are a hundred and one things to do and think about and prepare for and fight for.

And you know what? I'm ready. I'm done giving up on this dream. It's time to start LIVING the dream. And I know that as long as I'm compliant with my medication, I'll have the mental stability I need to make sure everything stays together, so I can change my life, and then turn my life's work to the work of changing other's lives.

My parents have been married for 33 years and honestly I don't know how my dad has done it for this long. While my dad is an enabler, he has always been a good dad and played both the mother and father role when we were growing up. We were 4 children with 6 years age difference between myself and my youngest brother.

Dad worked as a law enforcement officer and used to sometimes work overnight shifts. When he'd come home at 4 am, he'd jam open the bathroom door and find my sister and I sleeping inside the shower or sleeping outside, where we would be hiding out from my mother who would physically abuse us. She never did much of anything. We used to eat and have clean laundry because my dad played the role of BOTH parents while my mom would lay in bed and deteriorate from anxiety and depression.

Anyway, we're all in our 20s and 30s now and my mom's illness has progressed throughout the years. She is diagnosed BPD but I also KNOW she has histrionic personality disorder and narcissistic personality disorder.

She got into a fight with my dad a couple of days ago and threatened to falsely accuse him of raping her and domestic violence. Cops got called to the house, they asked my dad to leave. He's been staying at my house for a few days because legally the house is not his (it was left to my mom by my grandparents when they passed away).

Turns out my mom went to a rape center where they performed a rape kit on her. She's been staying at a battered women's shelter for the past 2 days which is laughable because she is always the abuser and aggressor. Detective called my dad into the police department yesterday where they had a 4 hour interview. My dad had to prove his case and show the detective all the videos of my mom insulting him and hitting him.

My dad has been inconsolable and we aren't sure what steps to take next or where my dad is even going to stay moving forward. My dad is disabled and retired due to chronic heart failure. He receives disability checks and doesn't have the money for an apartment. I should also mention that my 25 yr old and 28 yr old brothers are still living at my mom's house so I'm not sure how that is going to turn out.

Where should we go from here? What are the chances she’s bipolar and in the midst of a manic episode? How can I help my dad get back on his feet with such limited resources, and is there a way to have my mom institutionalized for at least a few weeks? What are the chances that my dad will be convicted for something he didn't do?

Please help! I'm dealing with the fallout from this and trying to figure out how to cope. I have to realize that this is kind of like a death and that I will need to go NC with my mom. I don't know how I will explain this to my toddler when he begins asking for his grandma.

i have a \*habit\* for lack of a better word that i've done since i was 12. basically, there are multiple ""alter egos"" in my head, and it replaces my actual memories with fantasies. this happens ALL THE TIME, whether i'm stable, manic, or depressed. i wanna know if this happens to everyone or if mine has crossed a point.

at 12 i experienced some bullying + being an awkward outcast, so i spent a LOT of time on the internet. that plus a love of writing allowed me to create different versions of me that checked off all the boxes the real me didn't-- a version of me that was a popular child actor with rockstar parents, a version of me that was a talented dancer, a version of me that was a youtube star. each version was popular, talented, and i can never make out their face but it's never mine. and i never act or do anything as IF i'm these people, they only exist in my mind.

and that seems normal, right? but here at 27, i \*still\* do that. these versions have STAYED with me, grown up with me and sometimes i don't even reflect on my ACTUAL memories and experiences, but make new ones up with my fantasies instead. EVEN IF THEY'RE POSITIVE!! I have a bunch of positive moments that I never look back on as they happened, but as if they happened to my alter egos.

like recently i went to see a movie alone, and after it was done, i pretended my alter ego watched it and had a cool group of friends to talk and laugh about it with but in reality i was talking..to..myself? i mean it, like i came home and just talked to myself as if i was her.

what's weird is that i DO have friends, and we DO things together, and when we're out, we are social enough to connect with others and overall have a good time. but i feel like i only remember that if i'm looking at an actual picture or throwback video. my fantasies replace a lot of the things in my head and i'm not sure if other people do that. 

like...it just feels weird and concerning that i'm going through life...essentially wishing i was someone else? **i don't feel connected to reality and it's starting to make me extremely uncomfortable.** even if this is normal, is there a way to reel it in? daydreaming and fantasizing here and there is fine, i guess, but what hit me was that a friend that i'm super excited to see invited me out and i realized that there's a chance i'll have fun, but i'll always look back on those moments as if they didn't happen to me.

I really wanted the opportunity to discuss the interaction between birth control and lamictal and really address the need for it as I use condoms every time and hardly have sex anyways because I'm terrified of pregnancy and usually have to pregnancy test to differentiate between my anxiety and being pregnant every time, as well as the opportunity to maybe look at a different med that didn't have really extreme possible side effects and possibly wouldn't make me dizzy either but my doctor pretty much just said it's a great med and I'm worrying for nothing and that there isn't really better option unless I want to go on bsupar, which I do, but everywhere I have read says that I need to be on a mood stabilizer or antipsychotic before I start it. I just feel really alone and confused about everything honestly. I feel like my doctor isn't really concerned for my anxiety that much or whether I keep my job which is honestly my only source of stability and ny paycheck my only source of happiness. And I feel like I'm being judged by my doctor for being mentally ill and treated like I don't want help when in reality I really do want help I'm just terrified of something worse happening to me than what I'm already going through and nobody wants to understand that. kind of just wanted to vent I know it's long af but I don't feel like I could be this honest with my doctor or my therapist or anyone really.",True,False,False,BipolarReddit,t5_2qzru,71834,public,self,super anxious about medication,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/w73xbz/super_anxious_about_medication/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,

But recently found out that my gramma was diagnosed and hospitalized with BPD for a while in her 30's, and took medication for this until her last days. Since then I have been wondering if I could be misdiagnosed, since my father (her son) and my sister (aswell) have some bizarre mood swings sometimes.

But, I've been on Vyvanse for some months now and my psychatrist says that if I was bipolar I'd sure have had an maniac episode by now triggered by this med So I was wondering if anyone here had some similar experience or have ever been on vyvanse before.

I’m super proud that I’ve been cooking all my food. Never in my entire life have I been able to feed myself breakfast, lunch and dinner. These hellofresh meals are good and it’s expanding my ability to cook without the meal kits because I now have a few basic recipes more or less memorized. This has been going on for two months. I haven’t eaten out once except a few times my parents brought home food.

My new puppy has been taking up 80% of my attention. It’s been very tiring but she is absolutely adorable. For the first time since we got her our senior dog played tug of war with the pup yesterday!  My other dog was a bit stand offish with this wild puppy. So this is going well.

I literally have the medication on hand to treat myself for months if I was dropped as a client. 

I can now say reading has come around again. For the last 5 years really I haven’t been able to concentrate. I became very frustrated over this about six months ago. I decided to get a book and go for it. The first one confused me too much with all the character development so after rereading the first chapters multiple times I gave up. The second took me 6 weeks to finish despite it being a shorter novel, but I did it. Now I’m reading another book and I can read five pages at a time without losing focus. I know most people wouldn’t be this excited over something so small, but if I can expand my focus and concentration, reading will help with the extreme boredom. 

My days seem to move at a crawl but tasks that have been too hard to handle these last three years are now taking little effort. I’m much cleaner because I have energy to clean up. My hygiene is finally picking up. I switched to a different pharmacy and no longer have to deal with problems at the other one. I really haven’t had constant suicidal intrusive thoughts for a year. Fleeting ones but nothing serious. 

I’m putting in 100% effort right now. I’m pushing the limits and it makes me sad and worried about the future knowing my full functionality is probably 10% of a normal person’s life.

I wanted to give my love and care to everyone in this community. Over the past 1 year since my diagnosis - this platform has been the biggest companion for me - which I have depended (too often) on to understand/love/hate various aspects of my BP2 diagnosis. I have been amazed at the people in this community

**The Expressers - Struggling/Venting**  
I admire the people who come here, share, vent their journeys and challenges. It takes a lot to put words to our struggles including vulnerability. I have seen myself in some of these journeys.

**The Inspirers - Fighting the battle for years**  
I also really admire people who are at it - fighting this, accepted it, controlling the parts of BP that they can through all possible channels - taking medication, having a routine, keeping their appointments.

I owe it to the bipolar community to make something of me - and not let the debilitating/adverse sides of this disorder or other negative tenets like procrastination win. I have been trying about things on how to fix me - without really doing the work to fix me.

**When Reddit becomes an addiction/ and you completely stop doing anything**

I have been spending too much time on these subreddits and on reddits. Sometimes like a defense mechanism I have been avoiding to think (similar for other video, content sites) or do anything so i do not have to think or fail at anything .

I almost live a groundhog day, repeating days of nothingness. I keep thinking tomorrow I will be better or even today at sometimes - but again open my phone/laptop/tablet and get into reading the nonsense news or something on reddit or youtube.

I had a procrastinating personality but with bipolar depression this has gone multiple times over - and now I feel I have a crutch/something to blame it on.

A crappy diet
to

When I'm down, music means nothing to me. I hear the words but it's basically just sounds. I can't really finish a song all the way through even when it's one of my favorites. I usually come away feeling empty and sad because it doesn't make me feel better like it does between episodes. 

When I'm up, I'm constantly playing or thinking about music. I get goosebumps when music is good (only when hypomanic though) and I'm constantly thinking about possible music videos or covers and remixes. I'm also generally convinced I could be a musician during hypo because of course I'm The Chosen One and destined to be a star. 🤦‍♀️

A few weeks ago…

My Gp referred me for a psychiatric evaluation. 

my appointment is not till September. I feel very suicidal at the moment. The urge has never been this strong. 

I went back to my Gp yesterday and he suggested going to hospital which I am open too. 

Has anyone ever voluntarily hospitalised themselves? 

What are your thoughts on the process? 
Has it helped you? 

Background information to help… 

My father has bipolar disorder but I am unsure weather or not this plays a part. 
Our relationship is non existent. There’s  little to no contact. 

I feel like this whole process would be easier if I knew more about his symptoms but at this point in our relationship it’s difficult for me to speak to him. 

Insight into my mood…

Most of the time I feel my mood is not very stable. 

My mother and girlfriend have pointed this out to me. 

I can feel depressed for a number of weeks then I will feel really amazing but always fall back into feeling depressed. 

I am irritable most of the time and get angry and recently being aggressive. 

I feel pessimistic about everything when I’m in this state of mind and I feel quite numb.

But 

I can feel overly happy at times and feel self important and can be very egotistical. 

I feel untouchable like there’s no one better then me.

I’m very creative but I find it difficult to finish anything I start when I feel this way. 

I make a lot of new ideas and plans that I do not live up too. 

I don’t sleep very well either… 

I get very little sleep during the night time and I uncontrollable fall asleep during the day due to exhaustion. 

I struggle with what seems like sleep terrors or sleep paralysis… 

I see dark figures and sometimes even hear voices and wake up screaming. 

I barely ever get seven hours of sleep and lacking energy due to this. 

This happens more when I’m in a depressed state of mind. It’s pretty frequently maybe two to three times a week. 

I’ve been struggling since my teenage years and recently went to get help. 

20 years of age right now. 

If anyone can relate or give any advice it would be great

She immediately told the teacher, the teacher told the principal, my special ed teacher shamed me (another story), and they called my mom at work. I was sent home. 

The school's reaction was pretty good. They had some follow up too, including an assembly about suicide and other problems. I shook them up. Although, at the time I didn't even realize I caused it.

My family...not so much. They took me home, my mom cried, she freaked out because they called her at work, and made it all about herself. I don't remember my dad saying anything. My sister was probably the most upset, but she was 12, she shouldn't have been the most concerned. That's what my parents were supposed to do. 

I understand things were different then. Insurance did not pay for mental health treatment. And the next year (The next YEAR), my mom saved up to take me to a therapist. But I needed to be hospitalized. Not only was I suicidal, but I had been for years.

Is gabapentin prescribed on a PRN basis to many people here? I took it daily for a couple of months and I think it helped my mood, it certainly gave me a profound sense of calm when I first took it.

About 5 years ago I was a horrible, horrible person. Always arguing, moody, jealous, envious etc. Then I went trough some shit and I think that’s when I just went into full numb depression. Then I met my boyfriend. I was in a better state, wasn’t a complete cunt all the time. Only some times. And then I went to therapy. I got diagnosed with Bipolar II, got meds. I got better, my mood was more stable. But I started getting…weird? I’m controlling, jealous, even though I shouldn’t be. My bf is great. We just got engaged. And I still freak out about things I shouldn’t, like his girl colleagues. Mind you… I also work there. I know them. And I know my bf wouldn’t cheat. I know these things come from me.

I just don’t get it. Is this my normal state? Being a pain in the ass? Tbh I’d rather be depressed. Or is this some form of mania? I’ve never been manic as far as I’m aware.  This is so weird and it’s freaking me out T_T

To preface : I haven’t been able to get ahold of my dr yet. I do have a pre booked appointment next week so we can talk about it then.

I couldn’t form a coherent thought in my brain and I could hear my laptop blaring noise and the bright light was coming out from it. I kept swiping to close it - but it wasn’t there! It was beside me shut off and I managed to feel it on the other side of me. Then nausea hit me and I thought I was going to vomit laying on my back. I guess at some point I just blacked out.

I became completely obsessed with the idea of Satan and demons and also regular angels but not as much as demons.

My meds got me better of course, but I stopped hearing voices when another patient in the hospital punched my in the face so hard that my teeth cracked. She said she prayed first and did it because she heard me say “hail Satan” and she felt Satan in me. 

I’ve been looking at studies as to why religion can seem to be a part of my and some people’s mental illness. And I hate when people say mental illness is demonic but I also wonder if that has *some* level of influence too.

Just want personal opinions and/or shared experiences.*

I'm going to be completely honest about what's been going on. 

It has been happening for over a month now. I have accepted it as my ""new normal."" 

I go to sleep at a reasonable time with taking Seroquel and Melatonin. 

I made another post about this weird thing - but I wake up between 3:45am and 4:30am every night.

I take extra Seroquel (am allowed) and sometimes an Ativan (for some  freakin reason I can wake up in a panic with adrenaline full-speed, thoughts racing, body buzzing almost shaking), eventually most times I fall back asleep within 1.5 hrs.

Then I wake up around normal morning hours, but as soon as I awake I want to DO things. I IMMEDIATELY see what things I can accomplish. I feel pretty good like I can do it all. 

I keep doing this until around afternoon I begin feeling quite agitated. Like bad. Like I don't know what I'm doing anymore. I become annoyed and impatient with others. I try to isolate. I don't want to say hurtful things to anyone.

Also the other day I spent over $700 on things I mostly could've done without. All I could think of was the dopamine rush of spending.

I absolutely CANNOT focus on windingn down at night - watching my favorite TV shows. 

Eventually I way ""F this day"" take my meds and pretty easily fall asleep. 

I just wish I could go to a hospital to get evaluated and meds checked out but I cannot due to no plan of harming myself or others.",True,False,False,BipolarReddit,t5_2qzru,71733,public,self,Maybe I'm manic and I don't want to admit it.

An SSRI unveiled my bipolar disorder at 16, and while I’ve been on a few for OCD while on APs/mood stabilizers without any manic switch, I never really thought to notice if they were helping my depression at all.

So I ask this because the bipolar depression has been especialy awful lately, Ive lost 20 lbs in a month because I cant get out of bed, Im just staring at the ceiling. Lithium and Lamictal were no gos. Im currently on 400mg of Seroquel XR, and while Im still depressed af the suicidality seems to be a bit better on it.

I recently got off of SSRIs completely due to fear of mood instability, and cuz wanted to try tackling my OCD with ERP and CBT therapy, but with how bad my compulsions are rn I guess I didn’t realize how they were still helping, just not enough for full OCD remission. Find myself isolating because of obsessions about my appearance, pulling my hair out multiple times every day, repeating sentences outloud for hours until the last syllable lands on my right foot when I count them out, religious scrupulousity, always asking for reassurance and apologizing for everything, I feel like I cant do anything 

But since Im very limited in options for bipolar depression, I was considering asking for an SSRI for the OCD while adding another antimanic mood stabilizer to ensure no recurrence of mania, with the hopeful added benefit of having some depression relief. I see a lot of ppl like Wellbutrin for the latter, but afaik it’s not helpful for OCD spectrum stuff.

I've been so withdrawn and feeling down and apathetic for awhile lately but now I just want to do so many things and am feeling really positive like I can turn a lot of things around and I just have so much ENERGY now and I feel great.

I've gotten so passionate (maybe a little obsessive or hyperfixated?) about a lot of things recently. I got really into k-pop for some reason, the music is HYPE and then I decided to start learning Korean? And I keep thinking like ""what if I just moved to Korea or something"" which is crazy because I have whole life here but I can't stop thinking about it?

And my libido is through the roof and I'm really focused on feeling sexy and confident again so I've decided I want to lose weight (like 20 pounds? 30 would be amazing but I don't think I can), like I'm not even overweight but I think I want to be really thin. So I've been dieting and it's been pretty easy because I just don't feel that hungry or sometimes I feel the pangs but can ignore it so I skip a meal here and there but still make sure I'm eating something everyday, like at least 600-800 calories. I've also just been smoking way more (try to keep it at most to a cigarette an hour though) so that's probably a factor.

And I want to like, redo my whole appearance. Going to get a haircut and dye it something really cool. I just bought a bunch of jewelry because I don't usually wear it and want to try it out, about $300 worth which isn't too bad. I make decent money. Want to get a whole new wardrobe too, I think I can cap out at $1000 for that and just try a lot of things online and return them if I don't like them. Maybe get my nails done?? Never done that either. (I can afford all this so it's not like I'm putting myself in the red).

And I want to go OUT now. I've been hitting up my friends because I'm so antsy about the idea of staying home on a friday night. I haven't seen some of them in awhile and they've been talking about going to dance parties and strip clubs and that seems like A LOT of fun. Last time I hung out with a friend a few weeks ago we were just hanging out drinking and he had some MDA (sort of like MDMA) and we did a bit of that and then he got some whip-its which I haven't done in a looong time but we did those and the whole night was awesome. I stopped doing coke over a year ago but sometimes I like getting lit with friends so that was nice. But I'm so excited that I feel like I want to see people again.

IDK I just feel GREAT and really want to use this to get a lot of things done and turn things around. I feel on a spectrum of really restless to literally like I'm high. But I can't really sit still and sometimes the energy is kind of a lot? Everything is buzzing and I feel sort of like my head is going to explode but not in a bad way? So I just listen to really hype music and it's awesome.

It's like I know none of this is *real* or my baseline but I want to let myself have this for now. I've just been so apathetic and uninterested in anything for awhile, is it so bad to want to feel this way for a little bit? To do a lot of things I haven't wanted to do for a long time?

Location: NYC


I have a family member, M24, who has been in a manic state since about March/April of this year.  He has been hospitalized for his bipolar / mania 2x in the past couple months, plus he's had 2 accidents (skateboarding/bicycling) that landed him in ER within this time period as well. His most recent discharge for his bipolar was about 2-3 weeks ago. Overall in his life he's been hospitalized I think 6-7 times. 

I'm trying to find the best way to communicate with him that he needs treatment and to consistently be on meds, but when he's manic he's very resistant to medication and normally won't end up getting help until the situation has escalated so severely that EMTs or police get involved. 

He disposed of his most recent prescription. He has lost his phone and ID, spent all his $$ that we know of. He lost his most recent gig due to being unaccounted and disorganizing/destroying a bunch of food that was supposed to be shared with fellow staff. He's been stranded in another state all week and we had to fork over hotel &amp; flight costs to keep him sheltered &amp; get him home. He spends his days ""networking,"" which is mostly him walking around into any business that interests him and asking for business cards. My family is emotionally &amp; financially exhausted with him and unfortunately some family members don't understand his condition and agitate him further by being argumentative. They want to set an ultimatum of not allowing him inside the home until he goes to the hospital, but I feel like this will only endanger him further. Is this a helpful or safe approach? I do agree he needs to go to the hospital asap as I believe he is a danger to himself, potentially to others only bc he can be very insulting/argumentative so I'm highly concerned he'll get into an altercation with the wrong crowd. When he's stable he is very docile and not a threat at all.

Just feeling very unsure and would love some insight from others. We're normally very close but it's difficult even for me to talk to him when he's like this since he doesn't want to accept the reality of his condition. Just want to help &amp; support in the best way possible.",True,False,False,BipolarReddit,t5_2qzru,71727,public,self,Best way to communicate with a manic family member who is resistant to meds?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/w4k2tg/best_way_to_communicate_with_a_manic_family/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,

I've see some posts that mania (I'd say hypomania for myself) can happen with antidepressants if you're actually bipolar? Any truth to this? Advice please!

The way I interacted with people and went about my day and how I was doing in school was always different to most of my peers. I had major problems with worrying about things and by the time I got to primary school I was slipping into some mild depressive episodes. 

Despite my many efforts to try get it sorted over the years I have never been able to pin down exactly what it is and how to treat it. I definitely have bad anxiety and depression but I know it goes deeper then that, all the normal fixes for depression and anxiety while they help never sort the problem out and a week later I'm back where I started. Personally my running theory at the moment is that I have bipolar and ADHD as I connect with a big majority of the signs and symptoms however I'm not a medical professional so I can't say for sure either way.

Now on to the title subject matter, I try to talk about these things with my friends and family and it is very, very difficult to bring up as I feel like they think I'm exaggerating or just trying to find an excuse not to do something. I either get discouraged to not seek a diagnosis and just carry on as normal, of course that will eventually kill me/ destroy my life, or I will send a big long message or link a video or website to help explain what I'm going through and why I think I am going through it and get nothing in response other than perhaps a thumbs up. Which really isn't what I'm looking for when I've just poured my heart out to someone that I'm close to, what I'm looking for is maybe a bit of encouragement and support but mostly them reflecting on my behaviour in the past and giving me helpful examples that I can bring up to the doctor to aid in diagnosis as you don't always recognise these things in yourself. And before you say it, yes I have asked them to specifically do that but I basically just get ignored. They'd rather I shut my mouth and go to work pretend as though I don't have these crazy mood swings which severally affect my well being. 

And these are people I wouldn't expect it from, they are generally nice, kind, understanding people but on this they just seem blind. My mum herself said ""I've gone through this for years with your dad I'm not doing the same with you."" Which means she'll love and support a man who lied to and cheated on her and essentially took a wrecking ball to her life for over 20 years, but won't with me for not even a year (that's how long I've been back home).

I'm not looking for excuses, I'm not looking for sympathy I'm just trying to sort out a problem that has been 24years in the making so I can go on to have a healthy and productive life where I'm not having to rely on the support of others to get through every day life.

i had the idea that i was being followed into every store because i used to shop lift a lot but i have been done with that for months because that was a compulsion within itself and i have been trying to cut anything from my life that could possibly contribute to my current delusions. so basically i thought maybe some loss prevention government armada was following me into every store to make sure i wasn’t stealing so i guess that little delusion has done something positive for me and stopped my stealing habits but now even without shoplifting anymore i still feel like people follow me into every store i go into i feel like people are there to watch me and make sure i don’t steal and i am in a weird head space and kind of scared to go shop. i never stole anything that significant just cheap clothes, makeup whatever. still i know these loss prevention teams can be crazy and maybe they recognize me idk lol anyways if that was real i prob would have just been arrested by now so i’m gonna bet on it being a delusion. so i finally talked to my doctors about it and my psych had thought i was basically on the brink of psychosis and experiencing like a borderline almost psychosis considering i was able to tell what i was feeling was probably not real but is still causing significant distress and was prescribed a low dose of risperdal (.5mg) i was also on way too high a dose of vyvance for my adhd (70mg) but had started that when i was 155 pounds and am now barely 110 pounds and she lowered the dose to 30mg. and that helped a bit at first. i cut out smoking weed and haven’t in about 4 days but until then i cut down from multiple times a day to just a night time but now being that i am still very paranoid even though it is improved alot since starting the meds and i am scared to irreparably damage my brain even though it feels like i already have. i still feel like i see the same cars same license plates everywhere and that people follow me into stores even when i drive in a different car then my own when i go with my boyfriend or my parents. i think the people are looking at me and looking at the other people j think i recognize and subtly laughing cuz they see how much stress i am experiencing. but the still coherent part of my brain is telling me that this type of following would take so much time energy and resources which make ot highly improbable. i can’t tell if i’m getting worse. i can’t tell if these are intrusive thoughts or if i am genuinely losing it. im so scared it’s starting to look like this may have nothing to do with substance and is now breaching into underlying mental health condition territory. i know this is sounding pretty severe probably and i am gonna do my best to communicate what’s happening with my doctor in our next appointment i am not scared to be diagnosed with bipolar disorder it would actually probably ease me a bit knowing that i’m what i am experiencing is truly just paranoid delusions. im so scared i won’t be able to take vyvance anymore which i need to be able to focus and get shit done for life and school but the stimulant may be not good for me. has anyone ever had a similar experience?

The one time, around 2012, I was out with friends in Pittsburgh for a Halloween bar crawl, and I eventually just gave an ""Irish goodbye"" as I tend to do when I get social anxiety (I'm definitely flight instead of fight...). 

I ended up walking across a bridge on foot, (scaled a fence in the process and ripped a good suit), and eventually caught a bus back to my neighborhood. At that point, I was drunk hungry, so I went to Eat n' Park (by myself, mind you). After that, I had about a 15 minute walk to my apartment.

The thing is, I didn't make it to my house. At this point, I was really experiencing black out/brown outs, but I do remember pulling a house's storm door until it opened. The next thing I knew, I was shaken awake by the actual inhabitants of the house...my memory was hazy, but they basically said ""WHAT THE FUCK, DUDE?!?"" 

The funny part, before I ran out of there, was that one of the roommates called the first contact they found listed alphabetically on my flip phone, my friend called Aaron. They called him and gave him hell because of me, and Aaron's a hothead, and essentially replied with ""well, what the fuck do you want me to do? I don't live in Pittsburgh..."" I don't remember if I grabbed my phone back before I split and actually made it home this time.

Looking back, I could've gotten in serious trouble if the dumb residents had called the cops, or god forbid it had been a family living there (they were grad students I believe, or undergrads). On other occasions, around those same times, I remember laying on a sidewalk outside of a friend's apartment, crying on the phone to my sister for some reason I don't fully remember.

In retrospect, I should've realized way sooner that something was up with me, mentally. These days, I still socially drink every now and then, but not to excess like in those days. My meds exacerbate the potency of the alcohol, anyway.

It’s been very cyclical through the years, which was a first warning sign to my therapist. I had a very bad depressive episode last month, and went to the hospital for suicidal thoughts. Since then, my therapist and I were discussing the possibility of me being bipolar. She screened me and I tested positive. I went to the doctor and they confirmed this, and I am now on depakote to help with mania/hypomania, on top of lexapro (which I’ve been on for a long time). I was on Wellbutrin, I think that may have been amplifying some hypomania. 

My problem is all of my family and friends I’ve told about this have been very surpised about this. I am a very introverted and quiet person. They find it hard to believe that I am bipolar and I feel like I have to convince everyone. One of my friends basically told me I’m full of shit, which is super frustrating because now I’m starting to open up to people and all I get in return is them dismissing me/telling me what I am or am not. 

Looking back on my past, it makes a lot of sense. As a kid I would go through phases of feeling really depressed, not giving a shit about anything to feeling really hyper and getting in trouble for doing really stupid things (I was not the type of student to get in trouble). More recently, I’ve gone through what I would consider to be mania, or at least hypomania. There are times in the day where I feel extremely hyper, almost euphoric, and that I can do anything. My self esteem is really high and I feel like I can’t do anything wrong (again, this is extremely unlike me-I usually have very low self esteem and hate myself). I get extremely motivated and clean my house for 5 hours straight and organize everything. This mania/hypomania has lasted a few weeks. I’ve never had psychotic symptoms but I have intrusive thoughts, sometimes horrible, and have had DP/DR in the past.

I have no life goals anymore. It’s a stark contrast from who I used to be even just 5-6 years ago. I had life goals once (collecting degrees and perfecting hobbies) and had feelings about what I wanted from life. Now I feel totally lost. I have no goals, and even if I try, I can’t get myself to care about anything enough to have actual goals besides getting through the day with acceptable performance. I’m just floating in space somewhere, nothing really makes me feel good (or bad honestly, probably the meds), so how could I feel driven to do, be, or work towards anything real? 

My sole objective is survival. I hoped I would exit that mode eventually (6 years post bipolar development, 8 months from hospitalization) but there is nothing. Legitimately nothing feels good. Nothing. Not one thing. Food is meh, can’t orgasm, touch feels horrible at time and like an expectation to fulfill, and I also don’t enjoy basically anything I used to (art, science, language, podcasts). I just don’t even know how to do it anymore. I want nothing because I enjoy nothing. I’m not even behaving episodic, this is the way it’s been since bipolar. I’m a shell. 

I used to be driven and passionate. I have a whole ass PhD and pursued many friendships, relationships, and numerous hobbies for most of my life. Now I just feel like I’m performing. 

I want to keep up, it’s become everything to me in the absence of any real enjoyment. I’m not living for myself though, or I’d not be living anymore by now. I’m merely fulfilling expectations, if even that.

I’m not doing badly honestly. I’m keeping up well and I don’t want to splat myself anywhere near as often these days. But..it hardly seems to matter.

Some context: My most recent diagnosis was that I have mixed bipolar disorder, general anxiety and possibly borderline personality disorder -- this was back in 2019 but I have not had a proper diagnosis again (which my last therapist suggested because she said I might not have BPD) after that because the pandemic happened and I have so much stuff to spend money on and mental health consultations are expensive where I live. I'm not under the influence of anything right now. I do smoke up every night, but my stash ran out. I only smoke up a small bowl of weed at the most, usually after 10 pm. It helps with the mental illnesses and sleeping. Anyway, I'm not a regular drinker either. Maybe I blacked out, perhaps it was a glitch, I don't know.

On to the story. I was eating Indo Mie (instant noodles) with a sunny-side-up egg -- yolk extra runny as per usual. I was eating it systematically. Noodles and egg white first. I left the yolk for after I was done with the noodles. That was all I had on the plate. I scooped the yolk up with my fork, it was still a whole yolk then, and then I bit it in half. I set the fork with half of the egg yolk back onto the plate and messaged my fiancé to tell him about how I've been watching Brad Mondo videos recently. This was done in 5 minutes tops. 

I looked back down to my plate to get back to finishing the yolk, and it was GONE. The only thing that was left was a very thin layer of liquid yolk that spilt on the plate, but that was already there right after I took my first bite. The solid other half of my egg yolk was missing from my plate.

Of course, I looked around to see if it fell off or if a rodent pulled it away, but if any of those things happened, then there should've been a trail because again, the yolk was very runny and I have a very furry rug right beside my bed, where I was eating. 

I don't know what to make of this. Did I just experience my first major glitch or did I just black out and eat the other half?

Today, someone I have been seeing for my prescriptions only for not even a year, is trying to claim no, I wasn't manic (even though I wasn't seeing her when I had this dx episode) but that I have HPD. I don't.

This prescriber basically expressed she doesn't care what other multiple clinicians have said or dx, that she will dx things herself.

I don't even meet the criteria for HPD objectively, but I met the criteria for a manic episode back in 2020...hence, why I am dx with it, and again, it was suspected before because my patterns of functioning and mood mimicked hypomanic states in the past. My therapist dx and saw a full out manic episode in late 2020.

I'm switching prescribers, but I'm so upset, and I've been in mental health treatment since I was about 13. HPD has NEVER been suggested, but bipolar was various times (thought to have possibly been bp2 for some time), until I was dx with bp1 by my therapist (who yes, has the credentials and education to dx and treat mental illnesses) and who knows me better, saw it happen, and has been with my for years.

I screwed up every relationship I ever was in due to this stupid condition, put my exes through hell and I can never, in good conscience, attempt to get into anything of that sort ever again. Plus, having children would be morally wrong because that would entail transferring this genetic garbage to the next generation.

I'm always tired, needing up to 10 hours of sleep. Or I'm embarrassingly manic. The only time I ever was in a work environment constantly made me wanna Minecraft myself. I barely finished college after 6 years of wasting money, skipping classes and sleeping away. I have no work ethic. I don't really care about attaining status, and since I'll never have a family, there's nothing to work for. My basic necessities are provided for, so there's no reason to go out in the world and embarrass myself.

I lost most of my friendships and made a fool out of myself in my social circles. I'm pretty sure everyone just remembers me as that delusional weirdo and can't be bothered to reach out. The only friends I have left are other weirdos with mental conditions.

In short, I was doomed from the beginning. I am a defective human being, a genetic dead end. For 20 years, I was in denial. I tried and tried again to make it work, always to fail miserably. 

But now, I have finally accepted my fate. I have resigned myself to living as a bum. I'll live for as long as I have health, food and shelter. And I'll Minecraft myself the moment things start to get bad. I can picture myself doing it, and the picture is clear.

tw// abuse, self harm

To preface this, I've been a lurker for a little while, posted maybe once. This is something I need to get off my chest that I'm not sure most people might understand. I don't know if I'm seeking advice or just venting. If you do have advice, feel free.

Growing up, my younger brother (I'll call him 'M') and I were best friends. We obviously were not exempt to our (more than occasional) spats-as any sibling pair are inclined to have. My brother is two and a half years younger than me and he has ADHD which causes him to be significantly more outgoing and energetic than me. Despite this, we had a lot in common and got along more than well.

At age fifteen, I began secretly rebelling against my parents strict religion. I was a model child, a prime example for everything a child of god should be. I was homeschooled too, with very limited friends or support. I realized I was gay and knew my parents wouldn't take it well. I hid it for them successfully for awhile. The next year was a spread out series of explosive screaming matches and psychological abuse from my parents, coupled with honeymoon periods and an attempt to ""find my religion"" again. My brother and I were still tight knit, throughout all of this, though, my youngest brother and M began spending much more time together than M and I.

At sixteen, I was outed to my parents by accident as both transmasculine and gay. This caused a massive fight. Leading up to this, M and I were finally repairing our relationship more. Spending time together. Bonding. I know that it hurt him even more when I left than it would've if I'd let our relationship fizzle. I wish I could go back and change it.

This event caused something in my to snap. I told my boyfriend (also trans) that i was a servant of god, that I was possibly even was god himself, sent to redeem us both of our parents bigotry. I told my mother I wished she was dead. I apparently told my boyfriend that I threatened to kill her, and to this day I don't know which it was. I pulled all nighters and locked myself in my room. I ate next to nothing and drank cases and cases of bang energy drinks.

Eventually, I ran away. Twice. Once for only a day, the second time for almost a week. A load of awful things happened. I was questioned by the police. I bragged about being able to manipulate them and get anything I wanted. The abuse worsened on both ends and I called CPS on my parents. My brothers were afraid they'd be taken away.

I had yet another screaming match with my parents. I was admitted to the hospital after my mother demanded to know if I was possessed. I told them I would kill myself. I self harmed almost daily. A little while later, they gave up. I was kicked out. I went to live with my boyfriend's family. The tension was insane. I lived there for almost a year.

Fast forward to today. My parents and I... made up? I've been living here with my boyfriend in their guest house since November. Here's the part that matters. My brother and I fight incessantly. His ego is through the roof. He makes occasional jabs at the things I did while manic and it sucks. My mom is always on his side too. She babies him. He's 16 and I'm 18. He resents me for leaving him with no warning and I resent him for getting everything I wished for at that age. His temper and mine are both very short and we both cry easily. We're both very good at saying hurtful things but it sucks to have my mother always backing him up. I feel like I am always in debt to them for leaving, though I left for my safety. All I want is to have my brother back but because of me, he's become so angry. I feel like he was happier when I was gone.

I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

But one thing I’ve noticed is that when manic or hypo manic I’m extremely hyper sexual and full of energy. I could indulge in hook ups and stuff for the hyper sexuality but I recently got out of something that did affect me emotionally a little and while I’m getting myself and my life back together I don’t want to complicate with hook ups and FWB and stuff. I don’t mind rebounds but I make it a point to not indulge in any new hook ups or sexual relations or any reckless behavior when manic. It’s really difficult to control. Coz all I think Is screw it. Let me have fun. Let me do crazy shit. Consequences be damned. And it’s REALLY difficult but I’m trying my best to control my behavior and not do anything reckless. And I’m naturally a very hyper active person so I alwys have a lot of energy. So it’s very difficult to manage the energy and hyper sexuality and reckless behavior and anger and aggression all at the same time while being manic and managing social relations and life in general. Luckily I’m on vacation so i can easily isolate myself in my room to avoid taking my relapse out of someone else. I usually gym as it helps me get out all these feeling and makes me feel better. It helps keep me stable so once I ended the thing I was in the first thing I did was get back to training. But I’m getting back after a very long time so there’s only so much my body can take and has to first get used to. So although I’m training about 3 hours a day there’s still quite a few hours in the day where I’m free so it’s even worse. I tried yoga, meditation, reading, sketching, so much but none of it can help me for a long time. The one thing that alwys works no matter how I am is gyming. But I can’t do that all the time coz if I do I’ll end up injured. Plus I have my periods coming up in a few days so my emotions are all over the place due to that too. So how do you guys remove all this aggression and anger and hyper sexuality and energy during mania or during a relapse?

Basically I feel a lot of ""positive"" manic symptoms that are triggered by it. Of course this doesn't last long.

It is more like when I listend to such songs on repeat I conditioned my body to react to it in a way like if I would be actually manic. Then I think to myself ""wow This feels pretty good"" and I remember ""all the good things about mania"". In this situations I start to miss feeling in overdrive, euphoric and I miss the confidence I connect with it. However my brain does not conenct anything negative to it. It is like all the bad consequences of mania are ruled out because I just simply feel this positive energy building up and I am like"" I whish I could be like this all the time"" and this often leads me wanting to ditch my meds.

I then really have to put in mental effort to brush it off and don't act on it. After a while I will stop thinking about it and this feeling vanishes again.

They’d take a lot of pics together but wouldn’t take many pics with me in comparison. I’d have to keep asking to take pics with them whereas others would just gladly do it. Even at my own bday party that they helped throw me they were ignoring me and taking/posting pics without me and other friends at the party noticed that and told me. 

They always saw me as a little kid even though I’m older than some of them. I’d try to express something I’m interested in and they’d look at me as if I were a little kid. For example I remember one time they asked me to control the music at a little get together and I was trying to show everyone what songs I liked and they all just went to another room and ignored me. Because I am a bit more carefree and don’t care as much about my image as them and am not as girly aka attractive I guess they would make me feel less worthy and like I wasn’t worth being associated with them. The day before my birthday I opened up to some of them in tears over this and then they posted temporary pics of me that would disappear in 24 hours but would post their other friends “permanently.” And like I know this all sounds so stupid and I don’t care about posting pictures that much but it showed a lot about how they thought of me

I was honest with them about my mental health. They met me when I was very manic and pretty much half of our time as friends was spent with me in a manic episode. They liked me more at the beginning because they thought I was fun but when shit hit the fan they kinda just stopped caring as much. They would talk shit about people with more severe disorders like bp and schizophrenia and bpd and even autism, basically anyone who was a bit too much to accommodate for and wasn’t fun enough. They talked shit about one of our other friends who was having a really bad bpd episode because she was very depressed and negative. I also noticed that they treated me better when I looked more feminine vs the few months after I got a buzzcut. And also when I first met them I was underweight and I felt like they wanted to take more pictures with me before I gained weight too?

I’d constantly ask them to hang out and they’d all say they were busy and as soon as I fell out with them I saw via instagram that they were hanging out together. As for why we fell out, well it’s because one of them told me that I talk too much and it makes her not want to talk to me as much as to other people. I had already felt this way before and let them know MONTHS ago and they all just made me feel like I was crazy. Turned out I was in a bad state of mind at the time because I was doing a lot more drugs than usual and I think they gaslit me over it because they knew. And I let it go and apologized because I thought I was being delusional.

What really made me feel like this was more than an unfounded delusion was that they kept telling me that “there’s no secret agenda where we’re all out to get you” but one of my other friends outside of this immediate group was told by her sister (who is in this group) that they all collectively decided to ignore me / be mad at me because I was being “rude” even tho the rudest thing I did was point out that they were being insensitive and manipulative. And also they told me I have too high expectations of them for getting upset that only 1 of them reached out to me about having covid. 

Just the fact that I was made to feel like I was delusional for so long when this is what’s actually happening is still making me feel crazy and like I can’t trust myself. I’ve asked other people who know all of us and they said they’re not really sure because they haven’t interacted with these people as much as I have. I was so sad by this that I deleted all my social media so I wouldn’t have to see them enjoying their friendship now that I’m gone. Again I’m not sure if I did the right thing and that my decision was based in reality or if i really did fuck this up.

I've been hospitalized 5 times and I'm 22. I've been on many medications before, but always stopped taking them because I thought I could control things on my own and that I was actually just overreacting and didn't need meds. 

The first day of Abilify felt like getting hit by a truck. I was determined to stick with it though. Thankfully the worst of the side effects have gone away. I still feel very physically tired though.

Honestly I'm not exactly sure what kind of differences I should be expecting or what's realistic to get out of medication. I just want to be able to have the motivation to get things done or at least become more self-disciplined. I probably will need more medications added to my cocktail but I was wondering about everyone else's experiences with Abilify. Also, if you've taken Abilify and Lamictal I'd like to hear your experiences with each and how they compare.

I'm a writer and going over some notes on a recent piece I wrote and people always seem to love the way I write love stories.

Long story, and it's been almost a year since I've spoken to him and it still fucks me up sometimes. I've just started getting back into dating but I find myself disinterested as soon as someone expresses interest. I've ruined almost every good thing I've ever had in this respect with my tendency to overlove until I hate them. Does anyone else do this? Or I get manic and break their heart on a whim and regret it once I'm stable. This has happened a lot. I haven't been able to be in love or anything resembling it without completely losing myself or being completely indifferent to the entire situation. I've been indifferent as of late after watching myself get hyped over someone only to be let down because, surprise, it's off-putting when someone is head over heels in love with you and constantly dying for your approval. I thought I learned how to stop doing that but now I just don't care because I don't want to hurt anyone since I already have way too many times. I wish I could talk about this in therapy but I was raised to feel like relationships are unnecessary and not an important part of life. I feel stupid when I bring it up.

I’ll describe my most recent episode

So it started off feeling so happy the world felt so beautiful and bright . I bought some stupid things and gambled a lot of my money . Id have all my money spent within an hour of being paid . I haven’t been able to pay my phone bill because of this and still can’t because it’s up on €400 which I don’t have 

I got kicked off my college course. My teachers said they don’t think i’m well enough to be in the class

I broke up with my bf of 3 years out of the blue and got with some random guy in a public place . I’m now disgusted by this and hold so much guilt . Me and my bf are back together and I told him everything 

There was a lot of talk about religion in my class so I believed that they all thought the devil was in me I was so terrified in there everyday i used to cry in the bathroom with the nerves it was so horrible 

I also believed god gave me a gift of seeing the world in a special way that nobody else could ( i’m not religious) 

I went out and blacked out drunk to the point they couldn’t wake me up and rang an ambulance 

I used to crush my perscription drug and sniff it ( xanax) because it use to dose me 

I was sleeping between 1-4 hours a night (usually around 2) and was not one bit tired 

Also took 2 od at the time but clearly they didn’t work 

Everyone was complaining about how fast and how much i was speaking 

It all felt so fun at the time but looking back i’m so ashamed of the way I behaved and the things I did . My family were constantly worried and I could of ruined my relationship for good .

Last night I smoked weed to calm down and chill out and had a panic attack and felt like I wasn’t real and now today I feel just like untethered from reality and I’m afraid I made the situation worse but I seriously can’t stand feeling like this anymore. 

I don’t want to quit but I do. My partner has supported me for ten years while I figured out what I wanted to do and this job is in the realm of what I want to do and is entry level. I don’t even know how to talk to him about it because while his salary covers our expenses it alleviates a lot of his stress having me bring in some extra money.

I thought I'd post my own journey/experimentation succinctly here and see if it helps anyone else/increases our collective perspective (?)

I was diagnosed (functional*) Bipolar I in the late winter of 2019 and put on 600mg lithium. I essentially hated a lot of the side effects right at the onset (metallic taste on tongue when day-dosing, slower/incoherent reading, befuddled memory) but felt I should give my psychiatrist's expertise a try. 

long story short, over the years I've now managed myself down to 300mg. I really like my lifestyle at this dosage and don't really feel it inhibits me in too many ways. of course, the ""what ifs"" always remain.. on top of being a teacher, I'm a musician/artist and there's a certain, idk, spiritual/mystical level I'm convinced I've just never been able to fully tap into once more as I could prior to meeting my friend, lithium. 

long story.. short (lol..), I've experimented/documented half a dozen or more tapering off trials, going from 300mg/day to 150mg. most recently I made it about 7 days. ultimately it was a disaster and, at the time, I'd concluded I'd never try this again. while I don't know if I could say this drop in 150mg resulted in a manic or depressive episode, it was like the juices, the faucet, the psychic faucet had just been turned on a notch more (which makes sense to me knowing the inhibitory effects of lithium). I really couldn't sleep as my mind just raced with thoughts all night, teaching was essentially impossible and idk how I pushed through, literally forgetting students' names. I lost all the momentum I'd gained over the past year, in terms of motivation in my Masters program, in terms of exercise (casually running 4 miles became basically impossible as my mind was just racing the whole while, I guess I'd characterize this as extreme restlessness). 

I'd initially hoped this was like a withdrawal period and after bursting through the dark cloud I'm come through out on the other side, beaming as I remember myself being prior to ever meeting lithium. but it didn't come and I concluded, at the time, that, no, 300mg lithium is great for me in so many ways and opens up so more doors in life I wouldn't have access to without it (I've read elsewhere some individuals saying the tapering off took as long as 2-2.5 weeks before leveling off? any further evidence of this?). I know that for so many of us working through mental health issues, to live happily off a mere 300mg lithium would be a Godsend, so I do indeed count my blessings. 

so that's more or less my tale and where I'm at. I've got another month and a half of summer break and am tempted to try again, I really don't know. the curiosity regarding 'the other side' is always there, which I'm sure many of you can attest to. 

I will say, I'm not posting this looking for 'advice.' I think each of us is really the only qualified individual to assess our own circumstances and journeys and I really have a distaste for commenters coming in and advising matter-of-factly one way or the other. but I would be interested to hear others' thoughts regarding their own journeys.

I hope this post has been a worthwhile read and not overly redundant in the subgroup. admittedly, I didn't dig too deep prior to posting (and also didn't spell check 🤣)

I also want to share this story because it was pretty traumatic. Back in high school, when I was 17, I was living alone since my familly had moved to another country, and there were no way for me to follow them without repeating a class. 

It all stared when, I was prescribed Ambien for insomnia. I was also smoking a lot of weed and being depressed (yeah thats your average teenager right there). Only took two nights of Ambien to make me hypomanic. I was hyper talkative, had racing toughts, unable to concentrate, horrible insomnia and I had really bad mood swings.

The next day, a psychiatrist prescibed me Loxapine, Quetiapine and medication for the side effects. She assumed I was stable enough to avoid going to a psych ward and go to my grand parents instead. The medication helped me sleep but it also made me feel really weird, like I was losing touch with reality. 

After a week I stopped cold turkey and just wished not taking any pills would make everything back to normal. It didn't.

Insomnia got worse, had a ton of panic attacks, and my behavior became increasingly agressive. The psychiatrist prescribed me Mianserin (anti depressant with sedative effects) to help me fall asleep, along with some psychotherapy. The symptoms progressively stopped in a month and everything went back to normal.

Its been 4 years now, I've quit weed a year ago and alcohol 6 months ago. However, lately I've been feeling really anxious about my mental health. Havent had any episode since but I'm really worried it might happen again in the future. Did any of you have a similar experience ?

I have constant mood swings, weeks were I feel hypomania, weeks where I have depressive episodes, sometimes mood swings throughout the day. I can get really irritable at times and it feels like I am not me. I have struggled with these symptoms ever since I can remember, it has hurt people and defintely myself. I have looked into Bipolar Disorder and BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder), because they seem to be the things I most commonly match up with, but since these things are more complicated I have struggled to get help or even taken serious enough to get a real diagnoses. I trust my doctors, but I know it’s something more, it always has been and I’m tired of struggling. I also have recently been put on anti depressants which haven’t helped much but I know it takes a while to kick in, but a side effect I have is an increase of bursts of energy. I told my therapist this and he says that’s not really a side effect, but It has me confused and scared.

bipolar2

I just feel like shit right now. I'm a girl and during that time of month, meds DON'T work. And I went into a bad manic spree that lasted awhile. During one of the few moments where I actually felt clear-headed, I realized that I was making mistakes and needed to fix them. So I tried but it wasn't something that could be fixed in a day. And I went back into another mixed episode, ending up with a bad miscommunication with someone. 

That person was hurt and I never wanted to do that. Short version, they and another friend were making something and the other friend it turned out, was copying someone else's work. I told a mutual friend but somehow it got miscommunicated wrong and they thought it was about the first friend. And during the whole time, I was acting more wild and being extra loud. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel so embarrassed by the way I was acting and feel guilty over knowing that I miscommunicated wrong and hurt their feelings. This disorder doesn't make you hurt people, but I feel like it did make me not say things clearly.

I’d never act on it because I have two kids and a great husband and I could never do that to them, but I still think about it. 

My PCP had been prescribing my meds, so I don’t have a regular psychiatrist set up. I’ve been seeing a therapist, and it’s nice to have someone to talk to, but it’s not really helping much. I have an appointment with a PPD specialist clinic coming up, and also have my follow up with my OB earlier that day. 

They always do a depression screening at these OB appointments and I’m so tempted by the catharsis of just completely spilling my guts about everything because they are so nice and I’m tired of putting on a happy face and white knuckling it through each day. However I also want to avoid being “put in the socks” so to speak. 

I have so little experience with depression and SI that I’m really not sure how much I can say before they are like, “Right to inpatient with you!” Is the fact that I have a psychiatrist appointment later that day likely to make a difference?

But I had one point yesterday when my parents weren’t answering after I’d texted asking when to call for my grandma’s bday that, a paranoid thought that I get regularly for a lot of people and creatures when ever I’m like this, popped up. I thought omg, she’s dead or dying and in the hospital, lots of old people die on their birthdays, she’s dead and they don’t want to tell us.

Of course that cleared up when they answered a few hours later, of course they were at dinner with her and I knew that but I also was terrified anyways. I’ve been paranoid mostly in that way (have had that a lot of my life) but also scared my abuser can hear my thoughts, knows my dreams, could overhear my therapy sessions and know my actions while nine hours away, scared he knew my texts and my calls and my search history and my posts, scared that I had done something terrible in his mind and messed up and that he was conspiring against me and talking shit and on his way home this second whenever he wouldn’t answer quickly. Didn’t help when he didn’t show back up without telling me he was coming, scared me shitless. 

My grandma’s bday is the anniversary of my worst sexual assault, dick had to do it that day, so it was a triggering day other than the call with her. Abusive dick wouldn’t stop trying to draw my attention away from the phone and call and wouldn’t stop making grips innuendos over stupid pointless things from topics in the call, I told him to stop after I got fed up and he did. he’s so narcissistic that he can’t stand my attention to be divided and has gross inappropriate behavior with my family. 

I saw her and saw she was fine but she had a cough and she was sleepier than normal. We did have a lovely long call once the guy shut up and she loved the painting I made her. 

Today I am impulsive, suicidal, about to go off deep end, trying to reason with abuser cos he’s the only person I have in nine hour radius who can help, that sound a dumb but I don’t have many options as I’m disabled and financially dependent but I’m planning to get away when he’s deployed. 

Then I get the text from my family that my grandma has Covid. And I know rationally that this is some type of hypomania or mania or mixed state or ptsd and that it isn’t my fault but oh my god it’s my fault, I jinxed it, I thought she was sick and dyi and then she has Covid and yeah she’s been vaccinated but she’s 86 and has bad dementia, my mom and dad are coughing too and my dad has a million health problems including asthma, everything is crashing around and I believe somehow I knew intuitively like how did I fucking know and call that when I know it’s cos I’m so paranoid it’s just bound to happen, a broken cock is right twice, but I feel like it’s my fault and she’s gonna die and my dad is gonna have complications and I’m not gonna be able to survive all this. Like I still have some shred of knowledge that I couldn’t have caused it but the universe it proving to me that I have this intuition and It is mot just paranoia and that I am being controlled and my abuser does know everything that’s happening as my hat I did jinx her and she’s going to die and it’s gonna be my fault",True,False,False,BipolarReddit,t5_2qzru,71576,public,self,"Been super paranoid, had paranoid thought yesterday, came true, I’m getting my grandma killed",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/w0rmni/been_super_paranoid_had_paranoid_thought/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,

So, uh, hi everyone. I am 24F with previously diagnosed bipolar 2 but am currently experiencing a manic episode wooooo

A sort of clusterfuck of circumstances have come together to trigger this bad boy I think. This is only day 2 of the absolute height, but what I am experiencing now is beyond what I would ever consider hypomanic so I'm kinda uh. Trying to get my ducks in a row before Monday as it were.

I have a full time job and have not had a severe episode since starting. Admittedly, usually when I'm hypomanic it goes pretty undetected unless people know me well. 

Currently I am:
- Not sleeping
- Not eating
- Have very grandiose plans
- literally cannot shut up

Plus racing thoughts and reality being a bit wobbly but that might be the sleep deprivation lmao.

I am meant to spend 8 hours in an office with people on Monday and I do not know what to do because I am visibly out of character and the behaviour is noticeable when I'm in one place too long.

I am currently unmedicated for bipolar as I was diagnosed with ADHD and not put back on mood stabilisers. This was fine for about 4 months but it started falling over last month and this week as completely collapsed.

(Basically, the bipolar and then-present mood stabiliser were in my referral. At the psychiatrist appointment for ADHD assessment and diagnosis, he did not mention my previous diagnosis of bipolar, my then-'current' medication (I had to stop it without supervision as I couldn't tolerate Lamictal tablets and was rawdogging it by the time I was seen for assessment. But it was still on my referral) and did not at any point ask about my mental health or medication history. Like, at all. I mentioned in the next session after a dyskenia side effect that I had developed tardive dyskenia on anti-psychtoics before so that side effect made sense to me. He did not question further. I made no effort to hide the bipolar diagnosis but didn't know how to mention it?? They have been weird sessions.)

Either way last review my stimulant dosage was upped by 5mg, titrating up higher as needed for myself.

Despite what I realise know were hypomanic symptoms and not just ongoing side effects of stimulants (aka trouble sleeping, being very creative, my usual stuff), I went up the next increment and 

Well

Now I'm here. 

This was a lot of rambling to say what the fuck do I do now, I haven't experienced this before and I'm very concerned about work on Monday.


I am planning to urgently text my doc tomorrow at an appropriate time as it's past 11pm here and I will be okay tonight. But also - what do I even say?? It's like he didn't read my whole referral??

Earlier this year I suffered from a manic  episode/psychosis, it was drug induced. I started smoking from a dab pen and at first it was at night and then it became earlier in the day and then it became from the second I woke up to the second I went to sleep uh oh - because of my genetics (I guess my family is supposed to stay away from weed &amp; this has happened before to a relative) this triggered full blown mania. 

I completely embarrassed myself in-front of like a ton of people… Not random people either ugh, people I know and have to be around all the time. 

I first thought I became a millionaire, and then I thought I was an influencer and that’s how I became a millionaire so then I posted a whole bunch of weird shit on my Instagram acting like I was famous &amp; then I texted literally like everyone in my life claiming I am a millionaire and that I can help them get rich like me and I made a group chat - I spent literally all my money on a whole bunch of random shit and a vacation? Then I embarrassed myself even further by making an entire Instagram page advertising a podcast I decided I was making, oh Jesus. 

After all of that (this is literally just cliffnotes too it’s MUCH worse than how I’m describing it) 

I basically got arrested and thrown in a cop car and taken to the hospital, I then thought it was all a test and they were just joking and they were fake cops which led me to make fun of them all and tell them they all have terrible names and I literally just sat there roasting all five of these cops who tackled and arrested me because I thought they were faking it and I was actually becoming famous and it was just a test 

- I don’t even know and I just assumed when I got to the hospital all my friends and family were gonna be there clapping and being like omg you passed the test but I actually got thrown into a room with no windows :-) 
And then I still thought it was a joke so I flashed the camera in the room they put me in, my naked BUTT! 

So then I spent an entire week in the psych ward and when I got out I was still a little bit manic and proceeded to continue with the podcast thing, posting on my social media about it, embarrassing myself further

And now five months later people still seem to be talking about it, whispering about me and looking at me like I’m some sort of basket case or weirdo and it bothers me, I’m already humiliated enough trust me.. I am a super shy and reserved person, it was really out of character for me to be so out there on social media. I just feel like no one really understands what I went through at all, especially at this age. 

I just feel embarrassed and I know everyone who knows me has talked about me and my mental breakdown and now sees me differently and it’s hard. 
Even people who haven’t even met me have heard about it and it’s making me feel super self conscious, I just want to hide under a rock. Ugh. 

I went camping a couple weeks ago with a whole bunch of people and I noticed some of them looking at me weird and whispering about it, I felt shitty.

So i am in mid teen and have a huge history of bipolar. Basically my whole mothers side is bipolar and on top of that, other mental things. And my dad, he doesn’t believe in mental illness, what ever the hell that means. Both sides have drug abuse genes or something. Dads side all heavy alcoholics and really into chain smoking. Mums side, currently my mum shares cocaine, my 55 year old uncle weighs less than my 9 year old brother, aunt recovery hardcore heroine addict. Im sure lots of families have that though having parents fron the 70s as they say. And parents are split so my mum lives in a caravan park and my dad has 2 properties (means alot with 2 bedroom houses selling for a million dollars here, yay inflation). Im trying to say two different lifestyles poor and rich/mid. 
To the point now. As i said im a girl in mid teens and starting off light. I hate school as every kid does and im very much expected to become some doctor but i am way too restless for that, id rather work my ass off 6am-10:00pm and earn money, i don’t know how to explain it but i don’t need all that money and i don’t want it, more exciting the other way. Im dedicated in joining the army or being a cop, everyone says that is self distractive and all that nonsense. At first it was a dream and now i am proving people as a girl i can do that stuff. With all the pressure i have on me i always feel like i cannot breath and want to roll up in a corner and stay there. 
So anyways i definitely know what bipolar looks like. My fathers like a doctor (this doesn’t matter much, but has anyone seen the show ‘archer’ and the doctor in that show, that is like my dad or the scientist in ‘breaking bad’) so i know the actual medical symptoms too. And its hard to take a test, talk to a doctor or not think about it because i know so much about it. Like my diagnosis would be rigged or something. 
So as far as my mental health goes and my symptoms. I’ve always never been able to sleep (insomnia), as a teen i cannot stop thinking of smoking or alcohol, i burn myself regularly and just tell people i am heat resistant because i haven’t been game enough to cut myself and have those scars (which i will talk about later), i never do anything on time, i cant stop over thinking, quote when im angry i just shut down and let it go and don’t care about things and life anymore unquote, Ive stolen a ‘few’ thing and haven’t planned to stop, i can never tell what im actually feeling, i get into fights, rather being alone sometimes then all the sudden being a social butterfly, i struggle with cleanliness like brushing teeth and taking showers, was sexually assaulted and harassed at a young age,i get extremely anxious, certain days i don’t get out of bed, extremely paranoid person people say im hallucinating but i doubt it. Those are the ones that i can think of at the moment being more specific. But mainly the fact that for months i’ll be skipping to school and doing stupid stuff. Then trying not to cry all day. If this matters my mother always says that mentally ill people like music, are chefs and are gay. No offence to all those people who are those things, she is basically shitting on herself but i cannot mentally handle a day without music, work with my mum as a kitchen hand and not into all that pride, community, naming stuff but *cough cough* yeah. 
And plus onto all that i had a gun club membership before i was twelve. 
So ages ago i told a friend that i was worried i had bipolar and it made things worse, i know he’s trying to help but he doesn’t understand. And he definitely doesn’t know how to help or even how to respond. It doesn’t matter now, after all that stuff i basically pushed many of my friends away and now the only people who are really left are the people who have to deal with me, my family. 
I have came to the conclusion with the likelihood and statistics, I’ve got messed up genes when it comes to that stuff. 
And i don’t want it, but you know what doesn’t help all this? Is people thinking mental illness is cool, people telling people any chance they get, posting that they are manic on Instagram, symptoms of bipolar on TikTok part 3. Its like someone cutting them self to show to there friends. All the openness kills me. Its good for people to get rid of stigma but somethings do not help. What ever makes you feel better about a SERIOUS disorder but it can get ridiculous. Im not targeting anyone on here, this is like an online support group with no cost. 
I just don’t want it. Its like a pros and cons list if i go and get myself diagnosed but less simply, thats not actually a good way to put it but certainly someone knows what i mean. 
You see if i get diagnosed then it would close the world to me. It would ruin my relationship with my dad. I wouldn’t be able to keep my gun license. Wouldn’t be able to be a paramedic, police officer or join the army. Wouldn’t be able to do those things especially if i had cuts on my wrists in stead of burn marks, no one realises. Those things are my dreams. And i know  the lifestyle of bipolar. Everyone looks at you funny if they find out, ask you if you are okay, ask if your on your meds if your upset, you will have to check a box on none sense forms when getting a job, will be forced to take meds and be hospitalised . Apparently lithium and that stuff makes you feel nothing, i don’t want that. But i need the help. I don’t want to talk constantly about it, i just want to get rid of that part of myself but at the same time i don’t need fixing. I wouldn’t be surprised if i was in denial if i got diagnosed but you know im an old soul or whatever so i have been thinking about this for a long time, like since i was ten, tiny me worried if i would go on suicide watch in fifteen years like my aunt. 
And as most of you i imagine you could understand is, i don’t have the recourses for getting help anyway. And unlike the weirdo attention seeking teens my age, i do not want this disorder.

I am diagnosed bipolar/borderline personality and have just started yet another depressive episode. It's been going on for almost 5 days now.

I am wondering if this has has anything to do with discontinuing antipsychotics I was previously trying (Abilify, Risperdal, and Zyprexa). 

All I take now is 50mg Lamotrigine/Lamictal and 20mg Fluoxetine/Prozac daily. 

I have called out of work several times this week. I just started this new job so I'm afraid of losing my job if I do not get out of this thing I'm stuck in. It's been so hard to get out of bed and to do anything productive. Taking a shower and brushing my teeth feels like a chore. 

I am working with my psychiatrist toward a therapeutic dose of the newly prescribed Lamictal which has to be done slowly, so I was wondering if I should consider trying another antipsychotic to help with my symptoms in the meantime. 

I do not even know if the Prozac is doing anything for me anymore aside from maybe helping with my anxiety.   

I don't drink or do any drugs aside from what is prescribed to me so I don't know what's going on.

I've known that I struggled with on/off depression since I was in middle school, but around my sophomore year of college (age 19) I started having a few days/weeks long periods where I showed a number of the symptoms of hypomania. A few months after one of these episodes I finally saw a psychiatrist for the first time, and after describing my symptoms over the past few years he very quickly diagnosed me with what he called a ""textbook case"" of bipolar II (along with ADD).

I finally started meds (lamotrigne/ritalin) and about 5/6 weeks after starting them I had what I thought was my first recognized and most prominent period of hypomania. My psychiatrist quickly upped my dosage I've felt waaayyyyy better since (minus a few weeks of feeling kinda down/chronically bored that were way more manageable than my depression had ever felt before).   
I study neuroscience so I was familiar with bipolar before being diagnosed, and I'm constantly worried that I unintentionally lied about or exaggerated my symptoms during our initial conversations. I've brought this up with my doctor a few times and he dismissed it, but now (having felt much better post-medication) I feel like my symptoms weren't harmful enough to actually fit the criteria. I don't know of any blood-related family members who have bipolar/any other diagnoses (but I'm irish catholic so it's not like they'd ever talk about it anyways🤪), not to mention that I've seen it a lot in my other relationships (including 3 of my randomly-matched roommates lmao) that I feel like at least some of us gotta be misdiagnosed lol

Basically, the fact that 95% of my friends over the past \~5 years have dealt w some kind of mental illness + no one in my family is diagnosed + I knew about the symptoms and had even considered it a possibility before being diagnosed makes me CONSTANTLY worry that I've just been secretly lying to myself and have just been doing it all for attention/whatever. The only thing I'm 100% sure of is that the meds have worked really well for me, and I haven't had any real depressive/hypomanic episodes since I started my current dose. I've always been pretty sure that there was something kinda funky going on in my brain lol, but I've never been convinced that I measure up to the criteria and that it's not just depression/ADD or something. Idk, I guess it doesn't really matter that much if the meds are working and I'm feeling better, but it just never stops weighing on me that I might just be lying to myself and the people close to me.

I’ve been sleeping pretty okay but had insomnia one night bad for falling asleep, finally did. I laid in bed and tried to sleep 5 hours this time before I gave up. I feel awake but tired. I feel like I’m in a mixed state cos I’m also depressed. Today is a reminder of traumatic things happened a year ago. But I wasn’t thinking about that and it wasn’t stopping me from sleeping, although I know it’s been worsening my mental health, along with a lot of issues with my spouse.

25M

Father is a bit obsesive and with focusing problems and hiperactivity (this helps him to have a positive mood somehow) but has managed himself without meds thank God.

Mother is a little bit not sharp in his thought agility lets say, this is a bit noticeable for some regular-smart people (not as important to mention maybe, but wanted to include as much info as possible). It seems like she has a bit Of autoinmune problems or allergy due to his pain in the spine and teenage years acne 

Obsesive, hiperactive , hiperfocused (in video games) since child and mild mood swings and some severe respiratory allergies since very small. Some very bad gut pain that made me squeeze in the bed appeared, stopped dairy for a while following doc advice and somehow disappeared. But bloating was here and there through my whole life.

15yo me:
When I was 15 started a terrible obsesiveness treated with sertraline, AP and Benzo that sent me Into an hypomanic state but cured me. Then put in sodium valproate (for mood stabilization) and risperidone. Was anxious and with Focusing problems unattended, as far as I understand pdoc didnt wanted to risk with more medication for a posible manic episode but always talked to her about it and just increased/decreased valproate/risperidone to treat that.

2015 (18yo me)

Was anxious, socially anxious/awkard with focusing problems.
Consumed weed at 18 while on medication and panic disorder erupted. Treated with benzos again, so far I was ok; then continued anxious state happened, pdoc1 added fluvoxamine to the combo, felt like didnt work and changed pdoc; then with this doc started slowly tappering off mood stabilizer and risperidone and introducing Zoloft which worked in about a couple Of months and was really good. After this, entered into a long sustained good feeling state until 2018.

2018 (21yo): 
Hypomania and alcohol/no sleeping gave me a psychosis/paranoia that lasted a day at its peak and left me a bad feeling for a month or so. Somehow my brain changed and I became overly religious (kinda schizo but not sure)

2019 (22yo):

Had focusing issues but while in this state managed myself to focus and work hard in the company I was working back then, which resulted in a free trip to China and upraisal. Started feeling some numbness in my emotions/thought, manageable though, but all along uncomfortable.

2020 (23yo):
I stopped the meds first time, didnt taper them off properly . Just as I stopped them, racing thoughts come by, body temperature changing by minute and it was noticeable in my face. So reinstated and everything worked not too well, but worked, had many focus issues and lost emotions then, but at least was able to be functional and enjoy life somewhat. 

Then 2022 happened, meet this girl, had a lot of sex and weed, with the numbness of emotion/thought and also sudden rushes of weakness wanted to stop Zoloft and we made a plan to do it very slowly in a year…then shit happens… as I tappered it a little bit (12.5mg or so) while smoking, my brain managed to snap and became psychotic/paranoid, 

somehow in that state as I was kinda concious stopped the weed bc was making me slow… and fully stopped Zoloft too (because oc the Holy Spirit told me to 🧙🏻‍♂️) and well…

My parents talked to the pdoc and they managed to gave me risperidone without noticing, which stopped my actions and reduced the delusion (it is worth to mention that in psychosis I also felt terrible body pain, tremors and pins a needles that I attributed to witchcraft the bad guys where doing to me oc), but when I came to “reality”also felt terrible left me without a soul, it just crushed everything I though I had and left me in a state of pure agony second by second.

No sleep , the worst numbness that will made me wake up in the middle of the night to pace until morning, just wanting to die each second of existence, no joy, no emotion, no body feelings, weird body feelings, racing thoughts, not able to lay in bed, intensely pacing through the day(it’s some kind of weird akathisia but more a feeling of desestimulation and dizziness that is just unbearable to lay in bed/sleep), derealization, intense anhedonia, weird thought dizziness (like my head spinning with thoughts), dizziness itself, weak thoughts, changing my mind through the day, weird time sensation, perception issues of space, socially desensitized.

So I requested the pdoc to give me an ssri (bc didn’t know what else to do) and he gave me paxil because of Zoloft shortage, so far Paxil reduced 10% of the continued agony, and nothing else. Took Zoloft liquid (as it’s the only one available) 75 mg for a month reduced the agony 25% (not anxiety, even though it appears as a slow painful anguish feeling, just restlessness, finding no comfort in no place), just raised to 100mg and it feels like I’m going forward for a reduced agony of 40%.

Right now I’m taking this:

Started Zoloft exactly one month and a half ago with 75mg with reduced agony of 25%. I stopped Zoloft for a period of 5 months or so. Raised to 100mg 6 days ago and can lay in bed for more time and somehow sleep through night.

Also I’m taking 0.5 Ativan at night 

The pdoc sent me Sodium Valproate but I’m not sure to take it because of my condition being critical don’t wanna mess it up.

So what’s next what can you tell me about this mess? What could work? What doesn’t?

So far Zoloft reinstating it’s working, how much you think convenient based on your experience to raise the dose and when…",True,False,False,BipolarReddit,t5_2qzru,71513,public,self,Trying to figure it out,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/vzedb5/trying_to_figure_it_out/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,

I was diagnosed with bipolar a few years back after nearly all my adult life being misdiagnosed as having unipolar depression, and medicated with antidepressants for nearly all of that. I love my Lexapro and whenever I have tried to go off it, I go downhill fast. 

For various reasons I’ve not found a bipolar med that I can take, so I have been surviving on Lexapro &amp; a vigilant sleep routine. 

I have come to realise that the reason I’ve done so well and been so stable these past couple of years is because Covid turned me into an introverted (relative) recluse with a very predictable and boring routine. 

But that’s gone all topsy turvy with life returning to pre-pandemic normal (relatives travelling and visiting me turning my routine upside down, friends expecting me to socialise which I think over-stimulates me, etc.)

So, I’m wondering what I should do. I seem to have two options:
a) contract my life into a narrow, stimulation-free experience (life-long Covid lockdown)

b) try and medicate even though I don’t have many workable med options and the public pdocs seemed to get sick of me complaining about every med they tried and bounced me back to GP with my Lexapro and promise to keep sleep hygiene rules.

I don’t know what to do and I’m doubting my two years of peaceful stability (I.e.

I met a variety of psychologists and psychiatrists who I thought didn't help at all and didn't do much to investigate, all saying I have severe depression. They had prescribed cymbalta and Xanax.

 I finally found a good team of psychoanalyst and psychiatrist who both seem to agree that I am going through bipolar disorder. The psychiatrist told me to stop the cymbalta (she says anti depressants can make bipolarism worse) and gave me quetiapine instead. My psychiatrist is amazing by the way. She gave me her WhatsApp number and lets me to message her whenever I need.

And this situation is so fucked up. My lows are so fucking low I want to kill myself at times. And it seems I have lost all sense of danger. I am doing dumb shit I never have done before in my life. I am married, but out of nowhere I started seeing hookers, and today i even fucked a man (I'm a straight guy btw). I have cometely lost control over my behaviour.

I am crying for no reason few times a day. Sometimes I just don't go home and sleep wherever I am at if I even sleep. My sleep pattern is terrible. Sometimes I sleep one hour, sometimes 12.

I totally cannot be left alone and I always want to be left alone. And I am so lonely.

right now i am on abilify, lamotrigine, and lithium.

lamotrigine does absolutely nothing for me. i got put on it during hypomania and i...got more manic. hasn't prevented depression either.

lithium is the one thing that has truly helped me. i started it during a depression after a gnarly manic episode. i have had a few very brief hypomanias since i started it but not very intense at all. i continued to get depressed on my period but nothing crazy. well kind of crazy. but short. i haven't noticed any side effects and it doesn't seem to have made the brain fog worse.

My current diagnosis is BDII and severe OCD, though all my doctors speak as if I have a ""new"" disorder (not yet in the DSM) BD-OCD. So I'm getting over COVID (currently 14 days since positive PCR).

Four days ago, I sky rocketed into mania, just as I was beginning to feel better. That being said, this time feels different. I haven't been manic since prior to adding quetiapine into my regimen. Now, the mania feels extremely odd.

I'm having many of the physiological symptoms of mania: talking extremely fast, full of energy (sleeping 3-4 hours per night), full of new ideas and plans, super distractible, intense anger and irritability. What I'm not having, and used to have, are delusions and hallucinations, feelings of grandeur, or illogical thinking. I'm still barely/if at all able to function and have left work early a few days in a row, only to read through 4 books and prepare for a lecture I'm giving in the fall. I also cleaned my house. And hiked about 9 miles over the last few days.

Trileptal and Tegretol were good, but they induce so many medications, so Klonopin and sleeping pills were not able to stop my severe PTSD induced panic attacks because they lower the levels by 50%-80%. Trileptal gave me some acne too but since it wasn’t as bad as Lithium I was willing to try to put up with it. But I cannot bear the panic attacks. They are anti manic agents so I am even more frustrated because my BP leans towards mania. 
AP’s did not help at all and made me worse.
I’m currently on Lamictal (which I have to deal with minor acne with, but I put up with it.) I am so thankful I can take at least one mood stabilizer but I wish I could adjunct it with something anti manic.  

I feel so hopeless. Every drug that has helped a little with stabilization, has induced side effects that made me worse. Anticonvulsants help me the most (along with Lithium.) I don’t know what else I can take. I can’t put up with acne, I actually went into mania because of it and I still am so insecure about the scars, so please don’t suggest to just “deal with it.” I’m in therapy, I’ve been in groups, the hospital traumatized me so bad I get PTSD flashbacks. Please just help, are there any other AC’s that stabilized your mood? I’m crying as I type, I am so desperate to be stable. I literally cannot take this anymore and I constantly make suicide plans because every second is literally unbearable and it’s not logical or desirable to go on.

I've been in the trenches with everyone else, facing rejections and abuses for being bipolar, even gaslit into believing that I was just a bad person. but I've been realizing i just don't have that around me anymore, at least not lately? my partner is incredibly supportive, my friends are great, and perhaps most shockingly--when it started interfering with my freelance business, i disclosed the disorder to my audience. and did not receive a single disparaging remark.

on top of that, i had a brief psychotic break a couple months ago when i got fucked by lamictal, left a ton of groups i had been a part of. dozens of people came after me to make sure i was ok/invite me back into all the groups I'd left once i had come back down to earth. since my ex that told me i was a monster for being paranoid, my biggest fear was people finding out about my psychotic symptoms and hating me for it... and the scenario happened, but not the consequence. they all accepted me back. 

I've been in a weird emotional situation ever since like... this doesn't track at all with my expectations. everyone wants me around. me. messy, undermedicated, still trying to figure myself out, and they want me around. last night i joined a new dnd group playing a rather eccentric character (i often play them intentionally bipolar bc they end up unintentionally that way anyway bc of my moods). one of the players I'd never met told me he really liked my character, and the two new guys really seem to like me as well (my bf is also a player with me and the DM is his best friend). and I'm just thinking about this all again because i think my default expectation going into a group is that everyone is going to reject me.

and it's just not happening anymore. i feel like that was such an integral part to how i experienced the world, and now I'm experiencing it in a brand new way. it's pretty nice, but i feel like a wild animal, I'm skittish as hell and worried people will change their minds.

Due to offsetting life events I lost controll over my daily routine.

My  sleeping schedule went downhill and so did my daily routine. My mood  went haywire and I fluctuated a lot between hypomanic and depressive  states. I wouldn't call it an episode yet because it was not as severe  but it was strong enough to make me pull all nighters being impulsive,  yet become hopeless and depressed and anxious a lot of the time. I was  scared of slipping into a mixed episode and thaught to myself that I  somehow need to force myself into old habbits. So I forced myself to  sleep somehow and to take my meds again and eat enough.

I  managed to do so yesterday. I took my meds like I should and went to  bed. Even tho my sleep was still interrupted a lot and I didn't have  enough sleep I managed to wake up at a reasonable time. I feel great  now. No anxiety, no depressed feelings, nothing. In fact I feel kinda  motivated and good.

I was thinking  if this is really due to my meds. I mean I ditched it for like a week  and a half. How can just one day really have such an impact? Do meds  really make such a difference or is this just placebo ?

I mean it is obvious that adhd meds have a direct impact but I never thought bipolar meds would do the same?

Newly diagnosed BP II who cannot stop analyzing her past. I'm trying to figure out whether or not this qualifies as a hypomanic/mixed episode and would love some insight.

A few years ago, I started a new job in a mailroom. The work was boring, but nothing terrible. During this period, I woke up at about 7am Monday-Friday and went to work. Every morning, I was so exhausted that I felt nauseous and sometimes threw up, and when I got to work I'd hide in the bathroom for small intervals of time and sleep for a few minutes, despite not being up late the night before. I didn't do a great job at work because I was apathetic and had convinced myself that my partner at the time did not love me, which was not based in any reality. Every day at work I would anxiously wait for him to message me ""good morning"", and if he didn't, I would convince myself that he hated me and that it was my fault. I remember hating this job so much that I would call in ""sick"" whenever I could, despite being a pretty good worker under regular circumstances. I also told myself that my manager hated me, which wasn't really based in reality either. Every day seemed pretty miserable for me, and I used to count down the hours that I would have to be there, despite it being a pretty low-stakes and easy job. My mood was also terrible, and I remember during this time getting in a fighting match so intense with my sister that I slammed the door on her and it damaged her nose. This has, obviously, never happened before. 

On one of my weekends during this period, I went to a music festival with my friends and was utterly miserable. Despite being surrounded by people I liked, I greatly wanted to leave and felt like crying the whole time. Music festivals generally aren't my scene, but usually I can put up with them for my friends.

Anyways, during this time I also experienced some hypersexuality and dramatically increased spending. Any down time on this job was spent looking for things to purchase, and I would happily talk about my purchased items with my coworkers. I spent pretty much every paycheque on random new obsessions and purchased lots of gifts for my partner, which I believed would make him love me again. One of these gifts even included a super expensive hotel stay at a quality hotel in our city, which I had never purchased before. I also put quite a bit of time and effort into how I looked, purchasing new lipsticks, perfumes, and clothes which I would think about all day while at work. It was weird caring so much about my appearance on some days and then caring so little on others.

This period lasted at least a month. My most prominent memory is that I remember feeling unstable and not like myself.

I have taken the first steps to getting treated. The last couple weeks have been really rough. I had to go to the Veterans Administration mental health and they sent me to an emergency psychiatrist which prescribed Zyprexa (2.5mg) to take as needed.

He said that he is going to get me a full evaluation consult scheduled but these should help me in the meantime. Had a couple questions though,

1. I read that most people take this as a daily medication. Has anyone took it ""as needed""? I was told to only take one if I feel an episode coming on. Wouldn't this effect me to keep taking it periodically?

2. How does it make you feel? What should I expect? Because I take it as needed, will I still get the weight gain and lethargic-ness?

This happened last week in the same way where she had told me to come pick things up a certain day, but then went on vacation without messaging me or telling the receptionists to message me that I couldn’t come get the samples anymore. I think it’s about her moving into her new apartment, she told me she was managing that yesterday. 

All this wouldn’t even be HAPPENING if she would fill out the damn form. I am tempted to go online and see if I could find it, send it to her sorry ass, and demand her to fill it out and send it to my insurance. There is no fucking excuse for this bullshit communication and bullshit lack of knowledge on how to do a medical necessity form. I am in a crisis rn and I can’t deal with this shit, I am about to just go to the hospital to get crisis care. I am going to call my doc office and (cos it’s military stuff and weird insurance stuff) ask to help get referrals to find a new psych. If she actually were to communicate through all this (not even to MENTION the amount of times I’ve left messages, voicemails, messages the receptionist took, and were never answered for a couple weeks, way before any of her moving into apartment stuff, not to mention her not taking notes on my conditions and thinking I was an addict(which no shame in that and recoverybut I’m not???)/not knowing what medicines were prescribed for/getting angry cos she thought I saw another doc besides her when I saw someone IN THE HOSPITAL and saying I needed to narrow down my doctors and choose/asking me why I was denying my partner sex when I told her he was sexually abusive/overall really not listening to my concerns, like had to literally beg for her not to take me off lamictal when she thought there was some small chance it was giving me a rash when I’ve taken it for years and she JUST started me on Latuda, the obvious rash giver, cos I would get suicidal and kill myself the second I’m taken off lamictal, it’s happened before. Needless to say the rash stopped when I stopped Latuda) then I would have the patience to continue but I’m done.

I’ve been writing things down and it’s slowly helping me. I thought I’d share something I wrote in case it helps anyone going through the same thing. 

I think because of the stigmas and people I care deeply tell me things that are wrong with me and just how negative it is, it’s making me see myself in a very bad light, causing it to actually define myself as undesirable in every way and that I’m flawed and broken. I can’t help but feel a lot, love too much, care infinitely, and try tirelessly. But on the flip side I get angry tenfold, and feel sadness as deep as the ocean. I think I need to ignore a lot of the negativity and maybe switch my perspective. Because I do feel intensely, it makes me appreciate most things people overlook in life, I can really tap into every emotion which makes me super empathetic and understanding from incredible levels, with all the scenarios I create under the sun- it makes me see things from so many different perspectives. All these things make me a very vivid person. I think sometimes I need to remind myself that my faults can also be seen as my strengths and I don’t think I need to prove that to anyone. I have to work on grounding myself more, but I don’t think I would change who I am. It is hard to manage, but I can’t imagine feeling a fraction of all emotions. It’s just important knowing how to control my actions and recognizing when I’m going off the deep end. It is a lot of work, but in the end I think it is worth it. I think it’s important to tell myself this for the sake of self love and self acceptance and that maybe it’s okay to love myself despite it being seen as flawed.",True,False,False,BipolarReddit,t5_2qzru,71462,public,self,Currently working through a depressive episode,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/vy953r/currently_working_through_a_depressive_episode/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,

I just got back from my doctor and I'm not feeling well.

The thing is, I feel stable (on Depakote 750mg and Dual 60mg) but I gained A LOT of weight since I started medication (I have intense sugar and carb cravings). Gained like 30kgs. I used to be a model and now I'm obese, I weigh 90kg. I'm so sad about this. So I decided to ask the doctor for a new scheme of medications and got out of the doctor's office with 5 prescriptions. One of them being haldol (liquid, 1 drop). 

I feel shocked. I'm a high-functioning bipolar, I will start my job as an university professor on the psychology field and I don't have many manic episodes. Let alone hallucinations or paranoia. I've heard of haldol for bipolars but on psychotic cases or strong manic episodes.

I decided to not take the haldol and start my new medication scheme (reducing depakote to 500mg, prozac for my weight and starting lamotrigine).

Wish me luck.

I got long covid and basically lost my personality. Turns out lithium was making it worse, so I’m off that and not as stable as I could be. But with that and a new antihistamine I was finally feeling like myself again. I had energy, feelings, motivation, things I’ve been missing for so long. It lasted two and a half days. 

So Saturday night my sister comes round for tea. I leave the room for a bit and come back to see that there’s food out on a makeshift coffee table. We never have food out like that because we have a dog, who is 15 I’ll add. I sit down, and lo and behold our dog comes in. Dad gets to corner of his seat, waits until she’s half an inch away from the food, and smacks her on the head.

Given that our dog has done far more for my well-being than he has over the past few years, I stick up for the dog. I said something like “Don’t hit her because you were too slow to stop her.” Which is an important step in my recovery from long covid because I literally haven’t had the energy to argue with him in 10 months. I’ve just been putting up with his bullshit. So he tells me to shut up. Then my sister decides she has to chime in and tells me that I’ve ruined what was a nice evening up until now. I just couldn’t believe what was happening and left.

I spoke to mum afterwards who said I was completely in the right. But the stress from that triggered a migraine and then depression. I haven’t felt this shit in a while. And the worst part which I can’t stop focussing on is that the only reason I’m stuck in bed while they’re out living their lives is pure genetic luck.

Long post. Please delete if not allowed. I just need some help and I don’t know what to do. My mother is diagnosed bipolar and Im looking for advice on how to handle a situation with her. I don’t know how to respond back to her. She and I are really close. We talk and see each other everyday. 

She often interprets most things as insults or threats. She grew up poor and bullied for it. It has really caused her to be on defense 24/7 and it seems to exemplify as she gets older. I don’t remember her being like this until I was about 16 (now 27). Her relationships are toxic. Her and my father are still married but it’s not healthy. Every relationship outside of her marriage and kids has ended. She’s physical so she will try to fight someone if she feels threatened. 

Now, onto the reason of my post. A few months ago I had a house warming party. Family and friends were invited. Family started to head out but my mom and aunt stuck around. My mom talks “a mile a minute” as she likes to say and she kept stating that she was leaving several times during her last convo but kept continuing on (something she does at every event and she is aware of this and laughs at it). Eventually my partner (we’ve been together for 10+ years and own the home together) was like “aren’t you leaving” in a joking manner and my friend said something along the lines like “yeah it’s time to go”. It was friendly but my mom did not take it as a joke, though. She left calmly. 

A few days after the party I received a bunch of mean, hateful texts. A bunch of terrible things that didn’t make sense about me and my relationship. I responded nicely, tried to clarify things and things cooled off a few days later and she acted like nothing happened. I asked my boyfriend about it and he said he and my mom were laughing like usual and he didn’t think she took it anyway at that time. He loves my mother and they do get along great. She calls him her son and vice versa. I tend to not tell him the hurtful things she says behind his back in an attempt to keep their relationship stable. 

Now several months later she has been texting me all week the same things. This time I wasn’t nice back. I know it made her more angry but there’s only so much  verbal abuse I could take. Every other week she is making comments about something that doesn’t make sense in my relationship or life.

I don’t know what to do. How do I handle these situations? How do I help her see that things aren’t the way she perceives them without it sounding like I’m calling her “crazy”. Are there resources that i can look into for myself to better my understanding on how to communicate with her? She never acts like this towards me.

I went in today wanting to ask for her to raise my lamictal because things going on at home like my abuser spiraling and me feeling like I’m caring for their “poor me for the consequences of my actions” mentality when they never have given a damn about the ptsd they gave me has fucked me up, and it is almost the anniversary of the worst assault that happened, I know cos sadly it happened on my grandmother’s birthday. It’s been in the back of my mind as I’ve been painting her a picture of her dog that she requested. I didn’t say all that cos I didn’t feel it was necessary to say past saying I’m impulsive, I’m feeling severely paranoid, having suicidal impulses at times, having bad self harm urges.

Instead, she wanted to keep focusing on the vraylar that I’ve been waiting a whole ass month on since she didn’t fill out a medical necessity form when she prescribed it last appt. It is such a foreign concept to her and her office apparently no matter how much I try to describe it, and my pharmacy is not willing to call and explain it to them. All she has to do is go on the insurance’s website, look up the form, fill it out and say why the medication is necessary for me cos I guess it’s more controlled, send it to my insurance, and I’d get an approval letter in the mail to take to my pharmacy. But she’s still confused and is determined not to do that but rather to make me come get samples.

They fucked up my appt schedules somehow, it was supposed to be the 19th at my chosen time but the new secretary said I had one scheduled for today too early in the morning. I have a later schedule cos of my husband’s shifts and I’ll work delivering in the evening’s, so I wanted to maintain the 19th, but I’m such a pushover that when she kept telling me “well why not get the sooner appt????” I gave in. 

So it’s early morning now, I’ve been having insomnia and so I haven’t slept much which automatically makes me very unstable/suicidal and I was planning to nap after this, and I had the appt. She was telling me I was manic, I’m like no. I feel like it may be a precursor to hypomania cos I’m getting really creative and having insomnia and verging on psychotic paranoia, but I am not currently manic. I was trying to tell her that I am in danger zone and need drastic help but she kept pushing vraylar vraylar vraylar, samples samples samples. I know for a DAMN fact that lamictal is what helps me most and I’m usually at a higher dosage with past psychs, but she wants me on vraylar cos she thinks I have more psychosis than I really do. I haven’t had psychosis in a year and a half and I’m pretty sure I’m bipolar 2 with psychotic breaks from ptsd cos it only happened around ptsd triggers, sure it looked like manic symptoms, but it only happened around extremely triggering things that reminded me of my sexual abuse. Kinda like what’s going on rn. 

I know the vraylar may help, but it’s new and I’m super sensitive to akathisia. She also said it may make me super nauseated and instead of going ahead and prescribing zofran if I need it, she didn’t. it’s like how we know I’m super sensitive to akathisia but she’s never gone ahead an prescribed something to help that along with antipsychotics. I know vraylar is a different category but if I can’t stand it, I’m going to be in limbo waiting for the next appt and hoping and begging through email that maybe she’ll emergency up my lamictal, same thing if it doesn’t help. 

I have to wait until the 27th to ask my primary doctor to please fill out the medical necessity form for her ass. I’m about ready to switch psychiatrists. I do not feel mentally capable of driving to go get the samples at this time and feel very unstable. She wanted me to come on her time today after she had told me to come last week then went on vacation without calling/messaging to tell me I couldn’t come pick them up anymore cos she was unavailable. But today cos she’s moving in a new apartment, she wants me to come before a certain time while she’s still there and I just fucking can’t. maybe if I could get more slee and come later in the day but y’all I am at my fucking limit and have been and my spouse is not fucking answering cos his phone is dead.

I’ve always thought that every time I have gotten depressed, but with this period last so damn long, I just feel like it’s actually going to stick around and I’m never going to be able to dig myself out of this hole.

I am so tired of feeling down all the time. Anxious all the time. Irritable. Useless. Worthless. Annoying. Reclusive. Empty. *Crushingly* guilty…the guilt gets me the worst.

I am now 29.I recently got a great job at the state park as an entry level park aide.

No matter what I do it seems like the world just wants me to get fucked over again and again and again. I’m sick of it. I just want something to go my way for once. 

I don’t even have a month left and I’m scared. I’m scared that I’m going to have to leave the life I’ve made behind. All because a stupid school won’t work with me. My account is on suspension. They don’t give a fuck for the mentally ill or disabled people who are attempting to go to college. 

Everyone keeps telling me it’s not the end of the world if I have to go back home but to me it is. If I have to go back home I’ll kill myself. I can’t do it again I can’t go back to the same place that gave me my damned bipolar brain. I would rather die. I can’t admit this to my husband either. I love him so much but I don’t want to hurt him. I don’t want to be toxic and the person who says they’ll kill themselves if something doesn’t go their way. But I just can’t go back. Nowhere in my town pays a livable wage. I probably wouldn’t even be able to land a job because everywhere is family owned or isn’t hiring. I wouldn’t make enough to move back up to college. I didn’t have a job before for the same reason. I couldn’t get fucking hired and I hadn’t even been diagnosed with bipolar then. I wasn’t hired because family had priority over anything else and it’s not like my family owned a business. 

What I find truly fucked about the situation is that I make enough to be fine and we’ll off. I just can’t pay the first damned payment for my college. They require at least 800-1000$ dollars for a payment and then they don’t really care so long as they get all the rest of what you owe. I can’t make the first payment because I had to leave the state early or be homeless. I just need to somehow get 800$ or more before some weird date in august. 

I have one tiny ray of hope but I know this isn’t going to happen. We have a truck driving friend who makes way more than my husband and I combined. My husband was going to ask if he would be willing to loan me money for the first month. I make enough to be able to pay him back and pay for more of my college within a month. If anything I’d be able to pay him back in 2 weeks. 

I’m hoping he’ll help me. I’d do just about anything to get money (except cheat on my husband in any way shape or form). Another thing we’re doing is selling a computer and monitor that are in good condition. I’m hoping to at least get 500$ for that. The monitor is extremely nice and it’s curved (idk if that matters) and the computer runs great. I’ll be without a computer which poses a problem for my online classes but libraries and on campus offers free usage of those things. I set up a go fund me a bit ago but that hasn’t been working. There are other people with legitimate problems on there my problem seems pathetic in comparison and because of that mine takes the back burner. 

I know I’ve ranted about this problem before but it’s all I can think about. I can’t sleep I haven’t eaten I just don’t know what to do. 

If anyone knows of any online jobs (even if the pay sucks) id love it if anyone were to drop that in the comments. 

(The only reason I haven’t been working throughout the summer is because my partner and I are in an extremely shady area. There are constant gang wars and gunshots going on outside. We get all of our stuff through online orders and try to avoid going to stores in person due to the high crime rates. I think in total I’ve gone outside 10 times throughout the entire summer.

Now as a 30 yr old in graduate school, I still feel the urge to talk out of turn in class but I scold myself severely if I do so. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have been through many different groups of friends because I am friendly and kind, but I ultimately end up pissing them off because I&amp;#39;m reactive and spastic and everyone hates that. I have a good job, but throughout the years I have alienated coworkers and pissed people off. Right now, I&amp;#39;m dealing with a similar situation at work. I was very close to all of my coworkers (or so I thought) but apparently I pissed them off in a meeting and they all kinda put up an united front stonewalling me. I guess I have nobody to blame but myself, but honestly I&amp;#39;m not even really sure what I did wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I lost my best friend to cancer in 2020 and my partner left me in 2022, so I basically have no friends or social contacts now aside from my parents. When I get invited to do things, I turn it down because I&amp;#39;m so worried about embarrassing myself. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m extremely lonely and spend every weekend alone in my apartment drinking and chain smoking. I consider ending my life, but I don&amp;#39;t want to hurt my mom.

I [23M] have had mild/moderate anxiety/depression almost my entire childhood. However, the last 2-3 has been moderate/severe and the last year has been absolutely debilitating. Interestingly though, my boyfriend pointed something out to me a few weeks ago and it’s really stuck with me and rose red flags in my mind. 

Every now and then, like once a week or at least a few times a month, I’ll suddenly jump out of this depression and go into this manic state. Ill go shopping, I’ll buy random stuff I don’t need, I’ll suddenly want to make plans with everyone and anyone, i start aggressively caring about deadlines and school work, I start smiling and I have this delusion that life is absolutely amazing. This usually lasts ~1-2 days and then BAM I’m right back in this debilitating depressive state. 

I have a doctors appointment in about 2 weeks to go over my mental health, however, it’s come apparent to me that I may have Bipolar Disorder Type II? Does my situation detailed above seem evident enough that I should bring up this worry to him?

I’m new to this thread.

I was diagnosed with major depression, social anxiety, borderline and adhd.

The therapy I’ve been partaking in has helped me tremendously in being more socially aware and understanding my feelings and to be aware of certain feelings and when they come on.

I’m 23 now and as I get older and gain this better understanding and knowledge, I’m doubting my diagnoses I’ve been given over the years for various reason. I’ve struggled with my mental health since 9 years old. 

I have noticed, tracked and made more note of my moods so I can track some sort of pattern. Right now I’m in a very depressive low state, I cannot leave my house as I’m dealing with crippling social anxiety and paranoia - this has been a growing problem over the last few years and what had gotten me my BPD diagnoses. I was told bipolar is out of the equation due to the fact I have adhd, is this true? 

Although I do have hyperactivity, I don’t feel like it’s constant even during a depressive episode; I lose all energy, motivation, become lethargic, I’m constantly trapped in a body that won’t get up and move! 

It was just last year and two years though that I felt the complete opposite; I started running a full time business pulling 3k a week, had more motivation then I ever had before, advancing very quickly in my life, social anxiety was non existent and I was making friends and networking more then I have in my life, super high sex drive, I felt like whenever I spent money I’d make money even faster etc any great feeling I was feeling it . This is the “me” that people want to see and the me that I had thought meant my depression was better? But I notice I tend to cycle between 1-2 years of being super great to 1-2 years of being horribly depressed like right now.

I feel like I’m two different people when I pull back and look at everything and the patterns in my life.

Like what could have caused this switch in mood? There are no triggers, I really have nothing to be sad or upset about but I just can’t shake this feeling of depression.

At first I thought I was exiting a manic episode and going straight into depression, but it’s different this time. I don’t know how to properly describe it. It feels like I’m in a constant scramble to find any kind of stimulation to not feel so low I can’t get out of bed. I just spent this entire weekend getting wayyy too into a card game with my friends and it felt like if I wasn’t going nuts with that I’d start feeling incredibly depressed. And tonight when I got into VR with my friends I was struggling to not isolate myself and start feeling depressed. I’ve also been increasingly irritable, getting mad at my friends for the stupidest shit. I found myself trying to get away from them while in VR. And every time I try to reach out to them I just couldn’t do it. They know about my diagnosis, but they don’t know I’m having an episode they just think I’m a little off because of the meds. My prescriber changed the dosage on both my meds so I can get used to the new one. I still feel exhausted and sick, I haven’t been eating or sleeping well. I know that’s part of the problem, but there’s so much I’m probably doing wrong, that I don’t even know where to start and right now I’m just trying to keep myself together. I just don’t know what to do anymore, sometimes I can’t even see myself with any kind of future. It’s so hard to work like this, I’m probably gonna lose the best job I’ve ever had because I’m so fuckin worthless. 

Everything just feels so fuckin hopeless right now. I don’t know how to fix it, I don’t think I can. I hate myself, I’m lazy, I’m stupid, and I push everyone who loves me away.

I was feeling more off than usual today, but I was forced to go and I was supposed to help my sister move after eating. Since it was a buffet, I hadn't eaten since yesterday. Lots of little things just pissed me off, and 5 minutes later after we sit down, my mother asks what I want, and I kept snapping at her, then she says nevermind when I try to tell her. So I smile, scoff, and just leave for 2 hours. When my father and I are driving to my sister's appartment, I tell him I'm done, I'm going to leave again, and he counters with ""You're not going to be welcomed back this time"", ""You're going to be written out of the will"" (which I was supposed to be written out of the will a decade ago, though not that I care), as I was homeless for a year when I left at 20. I said that's fine.

Then, my sister doesn't want me to help her move for obvious reasons, so my father told me just to walk around for 2 hours (without my wallet) and so I just chill next to a bunch of homless peeps. This area in San Diego smelt worse than San Francisco, so all I smelt was cigs and piss.

I was doing so well, I'm ~~still~~ was on track for getting into some Top 25-50 schools as a community college transfer student. I finished honors in 2 semesters (fastest at current school, average is 4-5), currently have a 3.9 GPA with 80 units, finished most of my major prep, earned 5 associate degrees (just gotta apply for graduation), and held down a couple jobs and got a ebike and a used car. I even got on lithium and been on it for a year, not really stable imo but I think it's better than before? Hell, when my car broke down a couple weeks ago, I'm now taking 6 hour bus commutes round trip again just to attend a single class 45 miles away. I literally only need 5 more classes to finish up.

However, I did all of this in 16 months and in hindsight, I'm crushed I didn't see this earlier.

I'm not sure if I was hypomanic or manic during this time, but I was extremely focused. Everything was fine until I took a mini vacation to meet up with a guy I met on reddit. Figured why not, I'm only taking 3 online classes and I haven't had a break yet. I spent half my savings on this vacation and it was the worse. He couldn't get hard, not even while watching porn, and had many problems, but overall was a nice guy. But I didn't get my catharsis I was looking for and I can't self harm anymore as my usual release/coping due to the many scars and I want to prevent more if possible.

When I came back, this led me to pushing all stress inside again, while taking 7 classes and working at a fast food graveyard job. But...I got in contact with my ex in Europe, and we got talking again, and I guess it was LDR. I was much happier and we got to catch up with each other over the last couple years apart. However, 2 months later, he gets COVID with serious nerve damage (I still don't know if this is a lie or not, but he never lied to me), then a couple weeks after, ghosts me. I know he's okay because I text'd his mom, so he 100% ghosted me. I went on a spree of trying to find hookups online, but was unsuccessful, which is probably for the best. 

After a month of the ghosting, I've spent another $1.5k on random shit, and then I've spent +$700 to fix my car. I've spent over 50 hours trying to fix this fucking car...my hands are covered in cuts, I've broken so many nails, and now I even have more scars I was trying to avoid. ON TOP OF THAT...my laptop which is my life like a phone for some people, the screen gets DESTROYED by a wood block my dad put in my car to prop the door open. I told him I didn't want that, since it wasn't needed, but I ended up letting him since we don't have the best relationship. Well, replacement screen is $100 and even then due to the damage, I don't think it's possible to install it...at least it still works but I need external displays. Not helpful when homeless.

Now, I have $400 to my name, and not even that, as I have many payment plan payments coming up in the next couple months. Maxed credit cards. I think I can finish up this summer term, but it's summer right now and its like 95-103F. I have just fucked myself, as I ~~have~~ had a stupidly good chance of getting into UCLA and USC due to student profile and my major choice. Honestly, I'm not even scared anymore, I'm so numb. So tired. Getting 3-4 hours of sleep if that, the constant bumping of the bus, intrusive thoughts that become vocalized constantly, and having to deal with people while taking so many classes at the same time. I guess I either overestimated myself or I reached a breaking point. I was so close...applications are due in a couple months and I haven't even started prepping for essays yet.

I have to wake up in less than 6 hours to bike 7 miles, just to go on a 3 hour bus ride and wait 3 hours for class to start, then wait another 3 hours just for another 3 hour bus ride. I guess, this was the extent of what I can do and...I have to accept that with all the bad decisions I've made and all the unfortunate things out of my control that have happened.

2020 didn’t help and since then the agoraphobia has gotten so much worse that I have not physically been in a public place since January 2020. I go to work, to my parents house, and home and that’s it. The thought of going anywhere puts me into a straight on, full blown panic attack. Add to it that with all the chaos this county is going thru over the past few years, I can’t watch the news and had to come off of social media because it seems like everything is triggering these days.  Financial situations at home have me in a constant state of panic and anxiety and it has legit given me an ulcer. 

The daily battle with the anxiety and then the depression modes is rough and I’m doing the roulette with my meds again. Dr just switched me from Lexipro to Cymbalta and also on Lamictal, Buspirone, Trazodone, and Xanax. 

All I want is to feel “normal” (even though I hate that term) again and be able to get thru a day without crying, vomiting from anxiety, self-harming (latest is chewing thru my lips and burning myself), thinking about running my car into a light pole, or taking copious amounts of meds and just going to sleep. 

So glad to have found the community here and it makes me feel not so alone in the struggle. 

I just wanted to introduce myself and to send as many virtual hugs as I can to everyone here. ❤️❤️",True,False,False,BipolarReddit,t5_2qzru,71404,public,self,Hi! I’m new :-),0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/vw2aig/hi_im_new/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,

Has anyone else been told this? Not asking for advice, just shared experiences! 

I have been apart of an intensive outpatient program. Part of my treatment involves meeting with my psychiatrist at least once a week to discuss my med management and addressing any of my concerns. 

She believes that I have Bipolar 1 because of a recent manic episode that I experienced in the early part of this year. It was extremely disruptive for many people and I came close to my destroying my life. The mania seems to have lasted about 2.5 months, with the height of it being 1 month. She suspects it was caused by some meds that my primary doctor prescribed me, following a psych evaluation I had in November of 2021. The particular med changes happened over the course of 3 weeks prior to mania - increase dose of Zoloft, one week of Adderall (caused S/I), and addition &amp; increased dose of Stattera. 
What I retained from what she told me was that I can’t receive a formal diagnosis because the meds are what triggered it. I would need to remove all meds and be closely watched for signs of mania/hypomania. 
In my time so far in an IOP, I’ve done a lot of reflection of my behavior in the past. It’s consistent with early signs of bipolar but I don’t know if I’m reaching or being dramatic. You know like reading horoscopes? The identity can be for anyone!

Sometimes I Just want to scream. It's just so hard processing all thats going in my brain. For months, I'll be in this catanoic state, then the mania hits and boom - my life is ruined in every single way possible. This just makes me run away from everything, and each time I do I start a new life. 

For some context, I'm a 17 year old high school dropout. Life wasn't always this hard, you know. I was once this student who excelled in school, had excellent grades and great friends to turn to. Then the depression hits, and I slowly started to be a recluse and boom, first was the brain fog, then the reclusion, the anhedonia, then the suicidal thoughts came in. That was when I started on antidepressants - bupropion, venlafaxine, and boom, two months into starting these medications and a suicide attempt from mania induced psychosis there I go have a lovely vacation into grippy socks jail. Then life I started on Lamotrigine, Sodium Valporate, Quetiapine, Olanzapine - you name it. For months, I once felt like I was stable. Sure, I think a bit I'm stable, that I'm on the right cocktail of medication - or so I'd like to think. 

All of this occured whilst I tried to change my identity. I left my old town, threw my phone into the river, deleted all traces of me from the internet and in reality. I don't know if it's a common experience with you guys, but I guess part of this illness just wants to ghost everyone and just start life all over again. I've done this countless times, I know it's not sustainble but hey, at least I find some peace. From then on, I've been more depressed, and I guess this is a last ditch effort into me somehow finding some warmth. Somedays I just want to scream into a pillow because, oh dear, it's just so hard to process everything around me. I haven't have any social contact, nor do I have any form of events, and I feel like I just feel so sick, I want to smash everything, I feel like screaming - basically I loose my shit. I feel like crying all the time, but at the same time everything just feels so irritable. This all just happens in my head, and it never happens in reality. I just feel like I'm going to loose my mind all the time.  

I feel so damn sensitive. Each second the clock ticks, each second I feel more anxious, irritable and horrible. It's this constant battle in my mind that doesn't ever stop. It doesn't go away with the medications either. I thought I felt stable, but I still see those shadow people. I still get extreme irrability. I hate the whispers that tells me negative things. And the worst part? I crave this exact feeling. I crave the instability, I crave for the depression, I want have this feeling that I want my conditions to be worsened. It doesn't sound logictal, but who am I to argue with such a brain like mine. 

I feel like I've lost touch with reality ever since my last trip into grippy socks jail. Somedays, I just feel like I feel like I'm viewing my life like a movie, I feel so disassociated from reality that it's gotten to the point that it interferes with my daily to day life. Sometimes, I also feel like I'm not living in this actual world. I feel like this world is just some fake, neurological world that my mind created ever since my last sucide attempt. For some context, I OD-ed on a bunch of Benzodiazepines. I don't really know, but this world just does not seem like reality. Maybe it's due to the dissociation, but hey I'm open to all suggestions. But I guess someday I'll find peace and rationalise with this world. 

I'm trying to start school again this autumn. It's somewhere far from my old home, but so be it. I'm not sure how that goes, above all things, I just scared that I'll get into a manic state and possibly ruin my high school career. Where I live, there isn't a path to get a GED. All I crave is a stable life, somewhere peaceful, somewhere quite, and I wish for all the thoughts to just stop. I think I speak for all that we just want to live normally. At this point, the only thing that's keeping me alive is my dog, my family and my medication. (Lamcital &lt;3) But even with all these medications, I still feel so fragile. As I said previously, and I say again that I feel like I'm just going to have a mental breakdown anytime soon. 

It's hard living this new life, I don't know how long I can take it. I don't know what's going to happen in next few days, months, years. But hey, that's life. However, on a positive note I just want to thank that this subreddit exists, although I know that probably not many of you will read this, it still means a lot to me. This illness may be hard, but you all are amazing people, and I love you all &lt;3

i definitely am not touching antidepressants again after the adventures in delusion that i've had, but i completely lack the willpower to knowingly and voluntarily throw myself into depression every morning taking meds. it was fine being slightly more ""down"" for a few weeks, and continued taking it to see if that would subside, but the depression very quickly became too much to handle. i went from unmedicated and feeling like life was a bit stressful but worth living, to feeling like if i had to live another month feeling like i do with the lithium, i'm better off dead. i lasted almost exactly 1 month before i had to give up because i'm starting to worry that if i keep taking it, i really will hurt myself. and it's weird to think that, because i've never in my life attempted suicide, and lithium is making me want to do it really badly. i thought lithium was meant to make you less suicidal, not make you suicidal when you previously weren't!

anyway, i definitely need to find a medication that won't land me in grippy socks. sadly, i'm allergic to lamictal, it sent me to the ER. i had heard that was a better one for not making you depressive, but haven't heard of any other options with that same reputation.

are you able to just take mood stabilizers without antidepressants and not end up depressed? if so, let me know what you're taking. i'm trying to figure out if anything else has the reputation of not making everyone completely fucking depressed in absence of antidepressants.

(i am aware some psychs will allow their patients onto antidepressants after a while stable on mood stabilizers, but since lithium has made me lose hope in living, i don't think i'd last long enough solo on a mood stabilizer that was making me depressed to be considered stable enough to try adding antidepressants. i could barely last a month of this before having to bail to keep from hurting myself. i'm not used to depression and have absolutely no coping skills whatsoever for it and nobody in my household is exactly gonna help me avoid killing myself since i live in a wildly abusive situation. so i'm very concerned about the suicide risk with lithium making me plan to end my life.)",True,False,False,BipolarReddit,t5_2qzru,71397,public,self,tired of med depression,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/vvriwl/tired_of_med_depression/,no_ads,0.0,,,ca25762a-9523-11e2-af12-12313b0ea9e6,dark,,,,,,

I was diagnosed with bipolar in 2013, tried lithium and seroquel for a few years, though had no benefit. I had more severe episodes on SSRIs prior to being diagnoised.

For the past few years, I've been medication-free on medical advice, which has generally been ok. I have tried both propranolol (didn't help much) and diazepam (gave me mixed episodes) for anxiety with no real benefit.

My mood has been pretty stable though my concentration could be a lot better. I still get very depressed in winter, anxious in spring, then fine in summer. Also very anxious or depressed before periods. 

I'd mentioned that I basically use caffeine as an antidepressant (have done for years) and can't stay positive or get any work done without it. The psychiatrist thinks I'll likely be fine on a low dose of amphetamine, though I'll obviously look out for symptoms of mania.

I've been working full time for years in a pretty well paid career, my relationship is ok (when my anxiety isn't wrecking it) and I get on well with family and friends. Bit apprehensive about risking it.

On the other hand, I'm hoarder-level messy at home, late for things all the time, don't have much of a filter, lose things constantly, always anxious, found it really difficult to complete uni and dropped out of a postgrad, put things off constantly and over react. If I could improve these areas, medication would be worth it.

I've been going to therapy for a year, which calms me down a bit, though I'm just going around in circles with it.

She said it wouldn’t cause weight gain. I’ve read on here that people have gained a significant amount of weight while on it. I’ve gained 50 pounds while on medication and am now obese. I do not want to gain weight on another antipsychotic, and am likely to not be medication compliant because of this. I’m extremely depressed, and weight gain adds to the depression. I refuse to leave my apartment. I also read that Paliperidone increases depressive symptoms, like taking away your motivation. What other side effects does it cause ? 

She also prescribed Seroquel for sleep issues. I’ve had racing thoughts before sleeping lately, but my biggest problem is not being able to wake up until woken up by someone else in the afternoon. Will Seroquel help with my oversleeping ? I also read that it causes weight gain. My psychiatrist says it’s hard to say if it does. If this is true, I won’t get it picked up from the pharmacy. I never used to have weight issues, I feel terrible, and I’m not motivated to do anything.

I had a 6 month long psychotic episode, with remnants of it appearing for another 6 months. When I was hospitalized, I was given 2mg of Risperdal, and a monthly shot of Invega. Neither of them helped in taking away my psychosis, and I countinued to experience symptoms until a month after hospitalization.

The Risperdal made me gain weight, so I asked to be taken off of it. While on the Invega, I experienced psychosis once a day, monthly. This could be correlated to marijuana use. I was experiencing brain fog, sluggishness, slow movements, and slow speech, and my psychiatrist took me off the Invega. My symptoms have not disappeared.

And it made me realize that if such standards constitute psychotic symptoms like hallucinations and delusions, then I’ve been in a mild psychotic state for quite some time now, no matter what state my bp is in.

I’m not sure if this is just my anxiety talking though, and I’ve never felt the need to bring it up to a professional because I thought it was just my anxiety (obsessions, worrying, intrusive thoughts, etc.)

As for what I experience..
- shadow figures &amp; evil monster type creatures usually hidden, that go away quickly once I tell myself it’s not real
- CONSTANT voices in my head saying usually negative things towards me at a distance (I figured it was just my anxiety).. these voices are usually neither my own nor anyone in my life’s voice, just a random persons voice.
-CONSTANT noise (music or static) playing in my head on top of the voices
-hearing people that are supposed to be nearby me (ex: my housemates or roommates) talking or mumbling when they’re actually not talking or not even there
-bright flashes of light out of the corners of my eyes
-when I close my eyes I see vivid visuals of different shapes and colors moving around (idk if this is just a normal thing but someone said it was a psychotic symptom so I’m just a bit spooked)
-seeing inanimate objects become real/anthropomorphic
-feeling and seeing things crawling on my skin

For most of these im aware that they’re not real but they still bother and scare me. the only things that remain constant are the noise / voices in my head, and I’m not sure if this can be considered auditory hallucinations or just my anxiety / intrusive thoughts. The visual hallucinations only pop up for a second or so and then go away when my brain realizes it’s not real, so again not sure if they’re intrusive thoughts either. 

These also occur regardless of other factors that might cause it such as sleep deprivation or drug use. I could go months completely sober and sleeping 8 hours every night at the same time and still experience these.

So anyways, lemme know if you think these are hallucinations or not, and if you’ve experienced anything similar to this. If so, I’ll need to talk to my psychiatrist about an antipsychotic I can take that doesn’t drug me out like seroquel. I really just want the noise to go away.

just wondering if raising your dose of lithium has ever reduced how flat someone felt, over time. i know the 5mg orotate fucking floored me and made it so my only remaining emotion was rage, but i'm even getting flattened at 1mg. might try seeing how low lithium carbonate can come and if i can microdose that lower than the lowest dose too, which appears to be the safest thing for me since i'm getting full effects microdosing klonopin as well, and taking a normal low dose of lamictal for 4 days was so overpowering it landed me in the ER. 

my psych doesn't know that there are many meds it would be safe to try me on, and the lithium orotate has mostly helped, it's just i don't like the fact that i feel creatively and emotionally flat 50% of the time, and wondering how the hell to combat that. the brain fog has completely vanished and i'm 24/7 exhausted so i know the hypomania has lost its stronghold but i just. don't really wanna do anything except boring shit anymore. like i can send emails and schedule doctors appointments and do necessary crafts, but i'm not enjoying creative stuff as much. i draw, but it's pretty uninspired and boring, and i've been getting frustrated at it.

i mean, i can still draw technically skilled art. that hasn't gone away, went to school so i've got the skills still. i can draw a still life or some crap and make it look gorgeous. i just... don't feel inspiration for more creative works unless i'm high as shit, which of course i'm trying to cut back a bit on the weed since now that i'm not hypo it's just knocking my ass out a lot lmao. i don't know that i need it for sleep anymore which is what my psych had approved its use for, i'm just kinda using it to try and feel less bland. the boredom is overwhelming sometimes. i enjoy the fact that i can think clearly again, but i have nothing entertaining to think about half the time. i just sit there feeling bored of being me. if someone isn't entertaining me i can just stare at nothing for hours now, and that's not great.

The thing about Clifford is he is always whining and crying. Whatever I can live with that. He’s pretty needy most the time and he’s on Xanax for his high anxiety. We only give it to him when necessary though. 

Well the latch on mine and my husbands door has been broken ever since we moved into her house. Meaning the door never really shut. You could just push the door open. Any time we would go out Clifford would ransack the room and I would have to wash the sheets constantly and clean the entire room. 

Yesterday we finally got fed up with it due to there being heavy rainstorms. During these storms Clifford would come into the room and claw at us and get at wires. Even with the Xanax he would not calm down. We fixed the door yesterday and last night was hell. 

He was full on bloody murder screaming. We would try to let him outside but he would come right back in. We would open the door try to sit with him but it didn’t help even with us comfort petting him he was still screaming. There’s nothing wrong with the house. No rodent repellent sounds, no man trying to break in, no rodents or bugs, he doesn’t whine because something’s wrong he just whines and cries and there’s nothing you can do to stop it. He isn’t in pain either, we just went to the vet to get him checked as well. 

Anyway I’m a heavy sleeper so I slept through most of last night but my husband isn’t. He slept for 30 minutes and during that time the dog diarrhea shat everywhere. We took that dog out soooo many fucking times and when he finally shut up he went all throughout the house and shit. It’s not like we abuse the damn thing. We gave him attention we tried to calm him down. Not only was there shit everywhere but that brand new latch on our door? Fucking useless. He cracked the entire frame from top to bottom I can fit the tip of my finger through the crack. The latch just falls off now. If we were to fix it we’d have to redo the entire frame. There was a huge rug acting as a carpet in the living room that was Mil’s grandmas I think. I know it was a family one. We had to throw it away. Couldn’t put it in any washer. Went to the laundromat didn’t fit in there. We now are having to baby sit the dog making sure he doesn’t get into anything else. 

I don’t hate dogs. I grew up with dogs and I’m planning on getting an esa dog within the next year or so. I fucking hate this dog though. I don’t know what else to do or to say. I’m not even going to try to sugar coat my hatred for it. If the dog died the next day I would not be sad. I would never hurt him or cause harm to him but I will never like this dog. Maybe I’m a horrible person for that but I just can’t stand it anymore. I can’t stand being clawed, I can’t stand having to reclean my room every day, I can’t stand having to baby sit this dog to make sure he doesn’t tear something up.

I started a situationship (47M) while hypomanic (I think) and caught feelings. I knew I wasn't ready for a relationship b/c of my mental health and told this person and they still insisted on getting to know me and help me. Spiraled into a severe depression and ended up in a psych hospital for the 1st time on my birthday (for reasons unrelated to them). It was a long time coming to be honest. I (or someone else) should've checked myself in years ago but never thought I was 'sick' enough even though self harming became a nonchalant everyday/multiple times a day type thing and suicidal ideations could quickly turn into a suicide attempt with one jerk of my steering wheel. 

Amyway, this person, my friend, dropped me off and picked me up from the hospital. Eventually I grew to rely on this person for validation and a lot of emotional support. Fast forward 3 months...after my psych visit was trying different meds to see what works. Became hypomanic (or manic, still trying to figure out the difference) started to not communicate with said friend for about a month, intentionally/unintentionally. I started experimenting with shrooms and smoking weed again. Said friend didnt think that was a good idea w/ my recent diagnosis. I admit I turned to weed to self medicate b/c trying new meds to 'stabilize' me seemed to be destabilizing me at the same time. I tripped on shrooms to see if possibly microdosing could help. I was just trying to feel better. Trying to fix myself. I've never liked taking meds anyway so the idea of finding something 'natural' to help manage my illness was alluring. Ended up having an amazing mushroom trip. Even called my friend to tell them about the experience but after our conversation I felt like they squashed my joy and excitement. So, I started to not open up to them as much as I used to because I felt judged. I didn't share my 'true' feelings with them, I just sort of became distant...I didn't ghost them though. I didn't  call or text as often b/c I was unsure of how to approach them since my mind at that time was hyperfixated on 'fixing' myself with mushrooms and how they're the answer to my problems. I didn't think they would care and thought they would shut me down.

While were weren't communicating I hung out with and talked to other people who did shrooms and smoked weed. Come to find out prescription meds are best until I'm stable and have a better understanding of my moods. I opened up to my physician assistant about what I was actually feeling and my meds were adjusted which snathched me out of mania and back into depression. Not as severe as it was but not being able to talk to my friend is making it worse. Tried reaching out to my friend and they've been distant. 

The 'new' friends I occasionally talk with now are no longer interesting to me and I long for the friendship I had with my other friend. They're the type of person I want to be when i grow up if that makes sense. Even though i am an adult, having emotions that feel uncontrollable at times has me feeling like im just being an overly dramatic child at times. I just want to talk to my friend and apologize for my ambivalence and for the times they felt ignored or unheard by me. Our relationship made me happy and they were always trying to get me out of my funky moods but i kept pushing them away. I hate myself for it and feel deserving of their rejection b/c of how i treated them at times. My moods were all over the place so my friend experienced quite a bit of my irritability and rage especially when I felt like they were trying to 'tell me what to do' but now looking back they were only trying to warn me. I've since hopped off the shrrom bandwagon for now b/c I don't have the energy to do anymore research so I'm just gonna stick with FDA approved medicines. I just don't want to have to use prescription meds for the rest of my life but it seems that it might be that way. 

Been wallowing in misery for the past couple of days. They said they would call me back but that was 2 days ago. We've never gone this long without having a full conversation. I'm worried my emotional shenanigans have ruined our relationship. I'm trying to hold on to what they said, which was 'I miss you too and will call you soon' but as each day passes without a phone call I berate and belittle myself. I took for granted someone who was willing to understand and help me. Nothing is exciting or enjoyable anymore. I've just been smoking weed and trying to get through the day. I didn't even make it to work today. 

I havent been sleeping well at all. Trying to wait up for them to call me back. Couldnt stand being home by myself and wanted to 'do something' so i decided to drive 2 hours to the beach at 9pm last night to make me feel better and pass time. I love the beach and used to go all the time at night. I don't go in the water just listen to the waves. Pretty much sped and smoked weed the whole way there. Had tons of energy even after taking xanax. Got back home around 5am because I finally had to sleep around 3am in my car at a gas station. They still haven't called. Gonna try and not reach out to them at all. 

Can hypomania/mania be triggered by events even when on meds? I have an appt with ny PA on Tuesday. Should I tell my PA of my symptoms or try to control them myself until my Tuesday appt? I'm not necessarily suicidal just walking through cement and my heart feels heavy and empty. I haven't felt this way in a while. I hate this feeling. I want it to go away. I feel worthless and like a horrible person. I guess I just want closure. If they don't wanna be close friends anymore then say so. They said I didn't do anything wrong but I can't help but feel like I did because of how they're treating me now. I'm finding it hard to function now because I can't get them out of my head. I feel like I'm just waiting for them to call me or text me. Every action i do is to just pass the time until they reach out for me. I fucking hate this feeling and am already depressed. I've texted them and told them about the anxiety their distance is giving me but they haven't responded and of course I've called them too. I realize that I may sound selfish so I'm questioning if my feelings are even genuine for the person or if I miss the relationship and the attention from them. Nothing is enjoyable. I just want this feeling to go away. Trying new hobbies, but nothing is working.  Currently taking 600mg Trileptal, Alprazolam (PRN), and Adderall. 

Can hypomania/mania be triggered by events even when on meds?

Should I tell my PA of how I'm feeling or try to control them myself until my Tuesday appt?

Is there anyone here who can relate or possibly willing to chat?

Writing this helped. I really appreciate this subreddit. Thanks for reading.

But I really feel like something is wrong. Like I don’t feel in control of my brain. It’s like someone else is calling the shots and doing all the work and life things and I’m just watching it happen. I feel so disconnected from who I am.

I also lose track of time very easily, like when I’m working I’ll get frustrated bc I can only concentrate for 30 min and then I look at the clock and it’s been 2 hours and I get confused on the time jump(I work from home). 
And there seems to be no rhym or reason why I click into depression or negative thinking and vice versa. No reason as to why I suddenly start having amazing thoughts and can conquer the world and am fucking the best human to ever live… 
My therapist said that you cant just suddenly starting thinking happy thoughts and that if I did then I really wasn’t in a depressed state…. 
Now I feel like I’m actually crazy and I feel like no one believes me and I don’t even know if I can trust myself or my own judgement. I feel like someone murdered me and has taken over my body and just destroying my life.

I have experienced hyper sexuality from a really young age (5) and a couple of years ago I think I had what was my first ""depressive episode"" (Hardly could be called that). 

My mum found out a month ago about how I suspect that I could be bipolar. She also found out that I was sexually assaulted and that I have attempted to kill my self (miserably failed).

This is all so confusing for me and the only reason I ever thought that I could be bipolar is because I seemed to have some of the symptoms. Idk. I don't really think I have it. I mean It's normal to feel sad at times and the hyper sexuality is probably my reaction to being sexually assaulted. 

Anyways, she found out about all of it and the only thing she cared about is if I masturbated and watched porn. Of course I lied and told her that I don't watch porn and that I barely masturbate. Last week she found out that I do watch porn. She was really angry and asked me if this was the reason I have been in my room for the last couple of weeks. It was horrible. I wasn't feeling well the last couple of weeks and that was my last straw.

Long story short I planned to kill myself (by drowning myself in the school pool) but before I could I began to feel hyped up. the first two periods of school I was acting crazy and I think that I scared my friends. They kept on going on about how my eyes looked weird (Maybe it was because I was crying all morning?). After those two periods I began to feel angry.

My treatment for ADHD was stopped whilst they got my bipolar meds right, and back in December I got referred back to start my adhd meds again, they finally asked me to call them on Wednesday. 

They asked why I wanted to restart my treatment and I told them my bipolar meds make my ADHD worse and it makes uni really hard.  I tried without them and I'm struggling.  She just shut me down and said ""well we won't prescribe to counteract the side effects of another medication"", said I need a general mental health assessment and ended the call.  

They aren't questioning my ADHD diagnosis, and my psych is happy for me to restart the medication I was on before, and has experience of treating adult ADHD just not within the NHS service (he's from overseas). He actually suggested giving me ADHD medication again, because it would also help with the side effects.  My MH is fine and has been for almost two years, although this is upsetting.  

I take 500mg of quetiapine, split into 200mg in the am and 300mg before bed.  I've tried taking more at night but anymore than 300 and I find it too hard to get out of bed in the morning.  Usually I get up around 7 and take my meds a couple of hours later.  I can still do stuff after my meds, it's just really hard for a few hours.

Any advice? TW: mentions self-harm/hospitalization

I don't know if anyone has experienced this kind of thing. Maybe this is just a rant, but if anyone has felt similar it would make me feel better knowing I'm not alone. I (23 F) have been in a relationship with my partner (24 M) for a year and a half. He's incredibly sweet and kind and he does his best to understand me and my disorder. I feel safe with him and like I can be myself. Our relationship is becoming more and more difficult for me to maintain because of my disorder and I don't know what I should do.

Some background on me: I've been officially diagnosed since 2014. I was diagnosed with anxiety/depression/ADHD at first because I was ""too young"" to be bipolar (despite showing all of the symptoms). Eventually, I was put on a Lithium/mood stabilizer cocktail and things got much better. 

My disorder has worsened significantly since 2020. It’s so bad now it’s hard to function. I think it's mostly due to stress, COVID, grad school, and an uncertain future. These days I really struggle with anger, irritability, hyper fixation, and serious thoughts of self-harm. More than ever before, even when I was undiagnosed. I've even started hearing voices in my head and these voices tell me to harm myself.

I'm in therapy and I go to the gym multiple times a week. It's still really challenging though. On the outside I seem fine but inside I’m struggling to keep it together. It's hard to articulate, but I feel like my disorder will target certain people in my life and blame them for all of these feelings of anger/irritation. I don't know how to control it. Somedays I just feel blinded by anger- usually at myself or someone close to me. I convince myself they are the problem, not my disorder affecting me. It's so awful but somehow being angry feels good? 

My feelings about physical affection/relationships, in general, will also fluctuate to very extreme levels. Sometimes I feel ""normal"" and I want to be affectionate but other times I can't stand to be touched. I feel grossed out and I can't imagine enjoying those things ever again. For a while, I thought I was asexual but when I am manic I feel like I have to have sex as soon as possible. I've been in sexual relationships before and I've enjoyed them. 

My partner and I have our differences but I do love him. I want to be with him. But sometimes I feel disgusted, disappointed in him, and confused about why I am with him in the first place. My mood swings are awful. One day I will be happy and in love and the next day I'll be angry and irritable with him. These feelings have been getting worse and these bouts of irritability have become more extreme over time.

One week in, my wife says that almost immediately it made me more mellow. I say at this dosage it almost feels likeca placebo.

Although i took it at 9am once and i alnost couldnt keep awake at my data entry job. I went to sleep earlier on a couple of days and felt sleepier.

About 20-30 min after taking it i feel a slight headache, slight nausea, and that ""i-can-feel-my-face-making-expressions"" feeling i get from pot.


I also notice, like a slight, but non-manic disassociation my own voice and body language.

I get my usual hypomanic symptoms the further i am away in tine from when i last took the pill.

Side effects, for me, include drowsiness, acute and slight nausea, more frequent urination, slight sensitivity (as if i had just orgasmed) of my foreskin and head of my penis, and my penis being in a state of semi-constant ""chub"" state, like not an erection or semi-erection, but right before, like quarter-hard, and finally more frequent and harder erections.

Critical disability studies defines disabilities, particularly mental disabilities, as a social construct, arguing that we should abandon the biomedical model and replace the DSM’s labels for disorders with just words like neurodivergence because the criteria for symptoms are too arbitrary and not embedded in biological evidence like a lot of physical illnesses. She alluded that labels for disorders are unscientific/inappropriate because it’s all based on testimonials from patients. 

I’m sorry, but I think these views are completely asinine and harmful to people with mental disabilities. Categorizing symptoms and creating a statistical profile of them based on ”testimonials” from patients is the foundation of medicine. Before X-rays, MRI scans, and other medical technology, all doctors had to go on was testimonials. I think redefining mental disabilities as a social construct does a major disservice to people with mental disabilities because you’re essentially arguing it’s not as legitimate as disabilities with clear, organic, pathological causes. 

If you have a mental disability, you’re going to get labeled as stupid, lazy, weird, or crazy by society anyway, so why would I choose those labels over the ones my doctors have given me? Why would I trust the opinion of an academic who specializes in critical disability studies over a scientist or doctor who’s more qualified to make those kinds of judgments? You know what, fuck critical disability studies.

BTW, she also argued that antidepressants are no better than placebo, which is complete horseshit. Further, she suggested we give placebos to people with unipolar depression, which of course is completely unethical. I can’t believe this privileged person has the nerve to invalidate people’s suffering like this from her lofty white towers of academia… whereas I work directly in the field helping people with mental disabilities.

I'm conflicted though because it's something I still care deeply about, I just don't know if I could accomplish that goal with my bipolar. My manic episodes can be so bad, and stress makes them so much worse.

&amp;#x200B;

Hey y'all, I was diagnosed with bipolar II 6 months after quitting drinking, 9 years ago. I was put on Lamictal and it worked, so of course I found reasons to not like it. The number one problem was that it didn't help with my panic at all and in fact,  exasperated my OCD(shown in fear of dying and others). The doctor added Celexa and it seemed to work, but in all vain honesty, I couldn't handle the weight gain. I stopped taking the Celexa and the panic and OCD came back, so I stopped taking the Lamictal as well. Within months, major depressive episode and couldn't get out of bed. Suffered until I had a manic episode and then cycled for 2 years. Went back on the Lamictal and then tried a couple of different anti-depressants alone with no relief, tried seroquel also but I talked myself out of that one. 

My anxiety got wicked bad last summer. I wasn't taking anything, had just moved back close to family after being gone for 24 years and I was questioning everything. I went back on the celexa and it seemed to be working but I got a weird heart diagnosis that ended up being a misdiagnosis and everything is fine. But I had to go off the Celexa and we decided to try Prozac. Man did that give me balls and not in a great way, went off quick and switched right to Wellbutrin. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I am currently only on Wellbutrin. When I first started I def got the energy and focus, loved it. 

I have currently been on it for 4 weeks and my depression and all-around out-of-control feeling without the speed of mania has set in like whoa. 

I have been struggling with the bipolar II diagnosis for 9 years now and I guess I am ready to accept it. I am working with the doc and advising that  I want to go back on Lamictal.

I am seeking advice into a situation I have very little knowledge on. My husband is off medication and has been adamantly researching and talking about ECT. I work in a hospital and am aware of ECT and have reviewed charts and documented on patients on ECT but through the lense of an ancillary medical professional.

Some background: my husband has been suffering from clinical depression and bipolarism for some time now. According to him, he's been on and off medication for years before ""us"" and got on medication a year before we got married (at my behest). He recently took himself off medication (against my knowledge) and it appears his psychiatrist is no longer of this world (he was very old). So my husband is not only without medication, he is without guidance. His depression and irritability have progressively becoming unbearable, to him and to me. I personally feel it has caused a lot major problems in our marriage that I've even sought divorce advice. We have two very young children and I've been trying to save our marriage while also setting boundaries. I'm not fully aware of his condition bc he's kept it hidden for so long and I've only known about it after a few years into our relationship. We've been together 8. He's been on medication 4. Now it's almost 1 year without meds and he's not doing well. Neither is our marriage.


My husband is refusing all forms of medication and only wants ECT. He's very intelligent and works a high-powered position. He's the main bread winner and his career success is essentially a part of his personality. It would cause great distress for him to lose his job or if his job found out he was mentally ill. I have talked with a colleague who has treated patients with high powered careers with great success but I want to hear other stores, not from a psychiatrist.

So my question is: can someone seek ECT treatment with success and continue their career and marriage as is?",True,False,False,BipolarReddit,t5_2qzru,71272,public,self,Anyone on ECT and still able to maintain a successful career?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/vslbhz/anyone_on_ect_and_still_able_to_maintain_a/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,

We were both addicted to drugs that triggered mania and were just horrible but I got clean a year ago and they were on the process of doing that(or so i thought). I told them to tell me if they relapse so we can work on whatever this is together and that i wont judge them since all i care about is their well being. They didn’t. 


I caught them lying multiple times and I ended up confronting them and gave them an ultimatum, lie again and it’s over. They did lie again. I told them I was done and they said they’d die if i left them.


I ended up ghosting them afterwards for 2 days to get my shit together and think of what i should do next and to my surprise, today they committed suicide again. the thing that fucked me up the most is the doctor saying that there were no drugs in the blood work and that they’re totally fine.

This post is with consent from my partner diagnosed with Bipolar 1.

My partner had a period of mania a year ago from June to late September. Since then, she has left the state, to start recovery and is now just getting back on her feet from that episode.

She just received a letter in the mail today in regards to being charged with criminal threatening with a dangerous weapon charge in the state of Maine. Talking with her, she is having a hard time remembering any specific incidents that may cause a charge like this. We are going to call the lawyer appointed to her to learn more of next steps, but we wanted to see if anyone here had any similar experiences?

My heart breaks because she's just starting to flourish in her new city, she found out this news on the first day of her new job. She's been med compliant and really taking her healing seriously.   


Looking at class D charges, the maximum is 1 year jail and $2k fine. My partner is trans and fears being in jail for any period of time and because of the manic episode, she has depleted her financials. This new job she got was supposed to help her get out of debt that she got herself into...

Any insight or advice would be greatly appreciated. I am going to cross post this to other subreddits.

We stayed Reddit-chatty friends for well over a month.

In that time I somehow (think I) fell in love with this person who refused to contact me in any other way. We declared ourselves a couple. To ourselves.

One REddit-only chat session she revealed that not only had she covered-up her booze and coke sessions, but had slept with 5 other people since we were 'together'

Given what I 'knew' of her frankly horrific abuse from previous partners, I was willing to move past this. But the seeds of doubt had not only been sown but fucking force-grown in the UV harshness of her behaviour.

Even when we had both agreed to control our substance urges (I'm an alcoholic), but aggreed to be honest.

About 3 days in she decides to radio silence me for 6 hours (despite my telling her I needed to speak. I was a bipolar alcoholic asking for pre-agreed help), then make me the bad guy for expecting her to answer to me.

That's off the table either way because I'm in a complicated situation so please don't recommend anything like that.

My last mania was a bit less than a year ago. I was hypo a few times after that but somehow recognized it and snapped out of it. My bipolar calmed down in the last year and I've had much much much less episodes than usual, and they were less severe. This is because of the external factors, my life is generally a lot better lately.


I'm so happy and think my life is perfect when rationally it's far away from it but I'm also so full of energy I can't stop my jaw from moving like im on ectasy and bitting the insides of my mouth from so much energy and anxiety. This all happened gradually. I became genuinely happier because I'm in a healthy relationship, we are in a good financial situation, I've had a glow up and felt a bit better in my skin, i didn't have a depressive episode in a long time etc. This contentment with life grew to me crying happy tears because everything is so perfect and I'm also perfect but also hyperfixated on losing weight and doing 1000 things to become more pretty (basically suddenly becoming obsessed with my self image, grades, carrier etc. In my previous manias this had been sudden but now it all grew to a place I'm in rn). I have obsessive thoughts about some stupid thing that keeps me from sleeping and is taking 60% of my thoughts and I can't stop any of them. I have so many plans and goals in regards to my looks etc that I can't keep up with them. I usually listen much more than i talk but now whenever any topic pops up, i have so much to say about it i physically can't stop. An hour ago, i thought i could read an entire 300 page book at once but also thought i was too smart and superior to even read. I couldn't manage reading 2 pages before getting zoned out. I'm so extraverted and energetic all of the sudden that people around me see it as a positive thing and strangers come up to me just because they think i radiate positivity etc. For now i, thankfully, haven't been impulsive or did anything i could regret.

This all seems not that bad or maybe positive but i literally feel myself slipping into mania and psychosis. One part of me would do anything to prevent it, but the other part is lusting for this feeling and finds comfort in the darkest parts of my life where i was literally loosing my mind. I don't want this happiness to go away because i think this is the only time in my life i was truly happy.

I never bought it. But I have a new therapist now who offered me something to ponder. 

She said there was something “beautiful” to my SI, because it fits my values. Specifically, that I don’t think I should have to put up with all this bullshit from life. It’s painful and I want out of it. Maybe I believe I deserve better!

I wouldn’t call it “beautiful” myself, because it hurts like hell, but I’ve taken this idea under advisement because for crying out loud I’ve had two hospitalizations in the past year, couldn’t ramp new meds, was fired by my treatment team *and* my employer, and discharged from a truly positive experience at an outpatient program the exact day I lost my job.

I need help, because right now I see myself continuing this habit until I destroy my life, with no sense of consequence. What can I do to put myself in the right direction, because I’m itching to go to a dispensary tomorrow ? I wasn’t able to get high yesterday, and I was noticably agitated. I feel a void, and don’t know how I’m going to survive, given my poor mental state. My story is down below, if you don’t want to read it, you can stop here.

I got my medical card last August after a 7 month tolerance break. Weed, combined with living in a hoard, Adderall for my ADHD, and gaslighting from my narcissistic mother sent me into psychosis. I was hospitalized a few days after I got my card, but I believe symptoms were showing up as early as June.

I ran away from my mother’s house to college, where my health completely deteriorated. I blocked my entire family. I was seeing signs of God, the devil, and my parents in the weather, on the Internet, and in my peer’s behavior. I isolated myself in my on campus apartment, looked for spiritual signs on YouTube, spent money on clothes and takeout, and spammed a man I was obsessed with daily. I isolated myself from my friends. I didn’t complete a day of classes, because I thought my school was part of a conspiracy and demonic. I voice messaged all of my friends talking about these conspiracies instead.

In October, my roommates had the EMT unlock the door to my room. I was topless and hugging myself, talking to “God” like he was an invisible man in front of me. I screamed “Christ” like a gust of wind was going to shut the door and protect me. I was dragged out of my bed and taken to the hospital.

When I got out a week later, all my roommates had left. I did the same thing I was previously doing. I didn’t take the medication that was suggested to me. I was afraid to leave my room. I wouldn’t meet with the school staff. I wouldn’t shower or brush my teeth. In November, I thought someone on YouTube was speaking to me, and I packed up my belongings like they were going to pick me up. I hadn’t left the apartment in weeks. On the same day, the school called my parents, and someone called two therapists from the hospital I was at. They said I wasn’t taking my medication and sent me back to the hospital. I don’t think this was right because even though I was going through psychosis, it wasn’t mandatory that I take that medication. 

I was in the hospital until December 1st. I spent Thanksgiving there. I would hang up on my family members whenever they called. The entire time I was there, and not smoking, I was psychotic and manic. I was out on two medications, and neither of them worked. I experienced psychosis for an entire month after being released, while I was medicated. I smoked immediately after I was, and thought someone was going to kidnap me for sex trafficking. 

I got back in touch with my father, and he moved me into an apartment in January. I texted my friend, who called the ambulance to send me to the hospital in August, and she cut me off. That’s when I started to snap out of the psychosis, because I thought I was telepathically communicating with her the entire time. I was extremely depressed after this, and lied in bed and ate all day, every day. Towards the end of the month I got a recreational weed plug. I instantly got psychosis after smoking, thinking people were talking to me online, music was demonic, and that my life was in danger. I couldn’t stop smoking after that, even though I tried to throw the weed away. I dug it out the trash right after, and the shame will stay with me forever. I was completely isolated, only had three friends in the city that I didn’t see, I failed out of college so there was nothing to do, and I briefly worked. On at least four occasions, I thought that I was being spied on, that I was going to get shot, that people were stalking me in cars, that signs were being sent from God and the devil, and that I could telepathically communicate with people on the Internet through muscle twitches. 

I had to move back in with my family since I wasn’t practicing hygiene, cooking, cleaning, working, and taking care of myself. I’ve been on the couch all day depressed and overeating. Last week I smoked my medical marijuana pen, and thought the left side of my body was possessed. I thought my uncle and my mother were communicating with the devil, and the red on my uncle’s computer screen and the red light on the tv was Hell. I thought my hand twitching was the devil and the government. I put on Christian YouTube to cleanse me. On the same day I recognized these were psychotic thoughts, and tried to scold myself for smoking. I finished the cart and have been smoking on empty carts until yesterday. 

I’ve been trying to post in here, but kept deleting what I wrote. I knew I was going to try to pull what I could from my empty carts, so I felt fraudulent posting. I tried  smoking all of them yesterday, but they were all empty so I didn’t get a buzz from them, which disappointed me.  I tried looking for a dispensary but the ones near me were all closed or about to close. So, I went to Starbucks instead. 

Weed feels familiar to me, like a friend when I’m alone. It makes me comfortably numb, and I’m complacent with life when I’m high. I’ve been wanting to numb myself and completely forget that I’ve been through this, until I spiral in to another psychosis again. It was present during multiple traumatic experiences, which I will make more posts about. I felt immense guilt for smoking weed, blaming my addiction for the abuse that happened to me. 

I’m going to see a psychiatrist this Thursday 7/7/22 to treat the psychosis and the other diagnoses that I have. I’m going to be honest about my weed use. The meds I was taking make me feel like a zombie, I’m slow moving and speaking, and I’m sluggish. I’m also not motivated or creative. I’m afraid I’ll never fully be myself again, and I will cycle between debilitating depression, and psychosis. I’m afraid I’ll never be able to take care of myself and have an adult life. I’m looking for support because I’ve hit rock bottom and I’m desperate for a reason to keep on going.

Some affect my daily life, while others don't are are just ""because I do this does it mean I have that"" type things.

I know I need some sort of mental help but I don't know what kind. I don't know where to start, what to look for, and to be honest I just don't have the mental stamina to go alone and trial and error all of this, let alone all the money it'll cost. 

Maybe someone that reads this has some knowledge on what I say, maybe someone has personals experience. I don't know. But im looking for opinions and pointers to the right direction. 

But yeah, its basically gonna be a scattered list of notes from here on. 

I have super bad anxiety. My entire life I would obsess and fear over bodily health, mental health, and others peoples health. 

Im a hypochondriac, I am too sensitive to what happens to my body, I panic if I don't have a direct answer to why I am feeling what I feel. I hyper analyze my mental and physical state to make sure everything is ""up to code"" and if its not I need a rationalize logical reason or I panic thinking im sick and dying.

I chase adrenaline but then I suffer from it. I love scary stories, fear excites me. But then it causes panic. For example, I love creepy pastas, horror stories, ghost sightings, and scary explorations during the day, but at night it hits back. I cant sleep, all I can think about is dragging back some kinda attachments or ghosts and panic all night. 

I get very obsessed with things very quickly but usually drop them after a couple weeks and sometimes it re sparks. 

I got obsessed with learning the guitar every summer for 3 years and completely drop it 2-4 weeks in. I watch videos, I read, I spend money on maintaining and upgrading, and I genuinely do practice, but in a few weeks it just dies out. 

I randomly with obsessed with pens. My explanation is that they're cheap and theres almost an endless amount of options to choose from so whenever Im bored I can drop like 30-50 bucks on a handful of pens and just test the out see which ones I like and dabble around for a few hours. 

I've had similar obsessions with skateboarding, hoodies, long sleeve shirts, jeans, caps, shoes, sticky notes, mechanical pencils, journals, gaming mice, mouse pads, alcohol, video games, books, headphones, keyboards, music making, film making, recording and editing software, bikes, camping, hiking, swimming, going to the gym, songs.

Basically anything that has options and variations, I feel like I need to compare all possible options and test them and pick out the very best one.

It also happens with shows and movies. If the show clicks with me I'll develop rushes on the characters, real or fiction, I'll become obsessed with the world and story and lore. 

Happens with real life people too. I develop these super intense crushes on people I literally barely even know and just obsess and think ONLY about them from like a couple weeks to a couple months.

Sometimes they're sexual/romantic other times they aren't. I had a huge Johnny Knoxville phase. Im not gay I just thought the dude was so incredibly cool and all could do was research and watch all his content for a while.

As much as it happens with mostly positive things it also happens with bad things. I obsess over little symptoms I have, headaches, dizziness. I sometimes focus only on my weight and worry when it fluctuates thought the day. I've focused on my body temp and just been measuring it all day for weeks. I've focused and panicked over m heart rate for a month. I focus over my mental health and mental illness. It always comes and goes in waves like every other month I'll just remember all my quirks and start googling and then get all biased with my quirks and actual symptoms. I feel like Im constantly monitoring and checking and testing my physical and mental sensations and quirks. 

I fidget a lot. I dont know if its stimming or what but I walk around the house when im bored and restless. Kinda pace since there isn't much room to walk. I dont know if its the repetition of pacing that feels nice or if its just the movement that feels nice. I sometimes clap out of boredom, I whistle and hum, I jump and bob around my chair. I fidget with my fingers or little Knick knacks. I wiggle my legs/ feet/ fingers. I sometimes make sounds or noises when Im bored or when im like concentrating and enjoying myself.

The dark always disorients me super bad. I think its something about not being able to see my surroundings, but the dark disorients everything and makes me panic.

My eyes sometimes like just get tired or something and do this weird thing where they get sensitive to light or something? Like it usual happens when im reading white words on a black background. My eyes just do this weird thing where they feel like more sensitive or something.

I struggle with eye contact. Its not too bad when Im listening but when Im talking its hard to look at someone's eyes while thinking of what I have to say without losing track. I think its because i know they're looking at me so there's extra pressure to not mess up and when I do mess up I know they are judging me.

I pay attention to peoples mouth a lot, probably more than their eyes. Again maybe Im being biased because I read about this being an autism symptom and Im scared of having it but mouths are really interesting to watch for some reason. The lips, the chin area, the teeth, theres a lot of variation and detail. But a lot of the time peoples eyes are kinda boring and just too static. Some people have nice pretty eyes and nice eyelids and eyebrows that are interesting to watch but yeah. mouths are more dynamic. 

I was always shy and awkward. I struggle talking to people because m mind goes blank and im too worried about how they see me and what they think of me. 

Again might be biased because I read about ""masking"" but when Im at my truest self I am very loud and expressive and quirky. I might come off as dumb because I act before I think. I stutter, I stumble, I say dumb things, I over react, I over exaggerate. If anyone's watched the streamer XQC Im kinda like that when I feel at my best.

But when im out in public I become a shell because I know its overbearing and too much and too weird so I try to like be ""normal"" I guess by muffling myself and being calm. It still stresses me out because Im so worried about making a good impression. But I cant because Im too nervous. 

When I was younger I'd need to warm up to people first. Like Id be all shy and quiet but after a few mins I would pop out of my shell and be all happy go lucky. but now as an adult its just sad.

I need time to prepare myself to social events. Even if its with close friends. I dont know why but I feel nervous when meeting good close friends. I guess part of me still thinks they'll judge me or maybe like Im faking my happiness/energy and Im not really lkie that in real life? Maybe I expect them to expect me to be at 100% all the time and if im not I feel like I let them down?

I thought maybe im an introvert but I still really like being around people. I like noisy busy environments and I like crowds. I dont really like interacting with them, but I like being part of them. I dont like being alone because it drains me and usually makes me sleepy or regress to negative internal thoughts and feelings.

I had a big fear of being left alone. I couldn't go to school alone (not sure how long but maybe to like 1st grade?) and would freak out if I didn't see her at the store, I also couldn't sleep alone at night for years.

I sometimes get what I think is sensory overload where im suddenly just like more aware of everything around me. This ""filter"" randomly wears off and everything is more open and im more aware. It doesn't cause me to freak out but its just a bit jarring and weird. This happens a lot when its dark because I lose my orientation of whats around me. 

Fluorescent lights are annoying to me. Again not sure if this might be normal but I really dont like them and its shocking to me why they're so popular. Like They don't make me run away screaming but they make everything feel so un home-y and so sterile and hospital-y. Why would you want that. 

I write down way too much. Its like a fear of forgetting something important or something so im always writing tons of thoughts and ideas down. I have journals, sticky notes, phone memos, word docs, google docs, just filled and scattered all over my room. 

I write down bad thoughts to keep them out of my head, I write down symptoms to keep track of them, I write down nostalgias to not forget them, I write down goals and general wants. 

I have bad intrusive thoughts that cause me huge destress and directly impact some decisions I make in real life. Like if I think something bad on a piece of food I have to throw it away so I dont get sick or something. 

I am always chasing nostalgia and get super depressed because it never feels the same.

For some reason I've always thought there was something wrong with me physically or mentally. Im always searching and comparing and checking symptoms trying to find something. I dont even now if I have anything but I keep searching. 

My parents and teachers always said I was fidgety and jumpy as if I was running on a motor, and my parents always threatened me will calming pills but never did anything about it. I was always good about getting my school work done but I kinda hit a wall in 11th grade. Everything just got super boring and I couldn't really keep up. Even in college shit was just boring or too complicated, Like chemistry, business, economics, and that were math psychology ""if this then that"" crap. Too many numbers and rules. 

Right now im struggling because im only focusing on bad mental and physical symptoms. On one hand I understand that MOST of what I feel is cause due to mental stress but I still cant stop obsessing over them. 

I also struggle to start things. I have so many plans and ideas but its almost impossible to push myself. The only motivation I get are there random manic like bursts that last maybe like an hour but then I lose all interest again.

I also have weird mood shifts. One moment im manic, feeling good and energized, the next im kinda sad, fatigued, weak, and bored.

damn this got long. Im tired. I literally sat here for like an hour just thinking and writing. If anyone's made this far props to you! 

if anyone has questions or wants me to add something more I will be happy to. I know there's so much more but I'm just done.

I have recently been going through a difficult time, but I have a therapist and manage it in my own way. My friend cut me out of their life, quite gradually. To go from being in someone’s closest circle to not hearing from them for weeks at a time is difficult to deal with, so I obviously panicked and tried to stay in touch. I would send messages reminding them how loved they are, things I thought they would find funny, and tried to organise plans with them, even though they live quite far from me. They ignored me and wouldn’t make plans.

They snapped recently and said they had been trying to remove themselves from the relationship because they couldn’t help me the way I needed to be helped. I was confused, because all I needed was some communication and reassurance while I am working my way through an emotionally challenging time. I would ask them to call, they’d say they would then they’d ignore my messages and calls and not tell me they were cancelling, then would get angry at me for getting upset. 

I initially felt like I had overstepped a massive boundary, but in retrospect I haven’t? It is worth fighting for the people you love. They even said our relationship hasn’t been the same recently, and they’ve been hoping it’ll go back to how it was before, but they are the one that refuses to message, refuses to call, and won’t make plans with me. I have never needed my friends to look after me when I’m unwell, I’ve always been self sufficient, but yes, recently I have reached out to friends for emotional comfort more so than I have done in the past because I was at breaking point. But isn’t that what friends are for? I’ve never taken advantage of their love or kindness and I’m careful not to burden anyone with every single thing going on in my life. 

I’m so confused. I know they are going through a depressive episode, but is it usual for someone to change the entire nature of their relationship with one of the people closest to them because of bipolar? I don’t understand it well enough to know if this is bipolar or something completely different? Has this happened to anyone else? I’m so lost and confused and I just want my friend back in my life.

First thing is my relationships

i have always been depending on false praise to carry me on, i felt like i was smarter, i wasn't like the children my age, since my childhood and never needed to learn anything else because my elders was praising me on stupid stuff i do that didn't need a praise, instead of learning meaningful skilles i just i kept seeking people praise and approval. and this problem still present to this day.
i have false expectations in relationships i can't understand what people think and what to say in a certain situation and why they say it so i depened on people emotionally to compensate for what I can't do.
i try to get as much emotions out of a relationship as i can by fighting, making arguments, showing people things i do or music or any other shit or just talking about random things (i've never had any meaningful conversation in my whole life) and i kept spinning in this same cricle for years: finding friends, show them the cool things that i have (i don't have any interest in what they got), keep arguing and making drama (i believe in everything i do in that moment i didn't intend to make drama i just realized that i have been doing so now), they lose interest, i get too attached as i imagine them by liking what i have that they love me unconditionally and have a valuable place in thier hearts.
i always either destroy that relationship because i got bored or start to beg people to stay with me through out my actions to the point where i lose my dignity and become hated and annoying.
i also sometimes can't understand the consequences of my actions, so i just keep doing it over and over.
This include relationships with friends and colleagues too.

Second is 
i can't think for myself. i can't think rationally, i have poor judgment, i feel lack of an interest in things that all people do, for that i have zero experience in everything in my life. i lack curiosity. i can't do shit without the help of others. And i have been in my comfort zone for almost 4 fucking years doing the same things over and over going on my bike in the night going to college without studying scrolling through the intenrnet and only making several friends online that i felt they compensate for my need to intract with any other human being.. so for that i lost alot of people isolating myself for three years losing myself in a depressive routine. 

three my concentration and lack of interset and curiousity and my memory
My memory is fucked
i neglected my study
i didn't study for four years because i lack concentration in class i can't focus on what the teacher says, plus runied my relationships with my colleagues due to what i mentioned earlier, and can't procces what they say only replaying in boring stuff. And i have no interest in learning stuff like ( college wise like the rules of certain system that I'm in and this applise to every system i find myself in).

Four my personality
My personality keep changing accordingly to whom i befriend. because i can't think for myself and have a meaningful conversation, and because i have nothing special so i try to imitate them (the way they talk the things they like even some catchvrases). 
i kept doing this over and over since my childhood that i now don't know who the fuck i am. 

i was so afriad of being unliked because my behaviors that i kept molding my personality to what people like to the point where i siwtched on autopilot noding for everyhing swalloing every insult going with flow not caring for everything just living on the false praise i get from my online friend's for stupid things i show them to get a feeling of worth until i lost touch with reality. i now can't even maintain one single prober conversation i just say veiw words to people who are talking to me, i only answer questions and reply in a boring or unrealted reply. Not to mention i have no opinion in any matter, and can't defend myself or ingage in anything.

Five my addiction to the internet
I've addicted to the internet (social media and porn) for 8 years 
all i ever did was making those relationships i talked about, scrolling meaninglessly through social media going from platform to another jerking off for everyday i even i have untreated erctile dysfunction that i ignored for several years.
i just kept doing that same things over and over for years only discovering somthing new in a long period of time.
The internet gave me what I can't have in real life so i lived in it..

Finaly neglecting everything
i have an erctile dysfunction that i neglected because i cant comprehend the severity of this thing. i always think that things are going to be fine tomorrow, i have zero responsiblty. i neglecte appointments relationships studying caring for my health my future i can't plan ahead as my life is so so fucking messy.......

now i realized, seeing how my online friends enjoy talking together, enjoying life intelligently, that they have something that i don't ( i used the think i was normal and only lack experience lmao)
normally i would just envy a friend for his normal life and try to imitate what he do (i learnt to draw just to impress one of them and learnt alot of other stuff just to get thier praise) but i noticed the pattern of my relationships and realized that's not what i need, i need to enjoy a normal life..

Ps
Idk what am hoping to get from typing this here lmao but im just tired i just want to enjoy life like normal people do.
myabe all of this is just from a trauma that i had and made me lose myself as i became dependent on what people think of me and on the internet to a point where i lost the ability to think for myself
i used to get bullied alot, and my dad used to yell at me if i did a stupid thing (instead of crying or expressing myself i would go to play with my phone trying to forget about how stupid i am lol)

i also came up with a great plan with my friend. i’m not sure if i’m gonna get on the plane back to my country, i wanna stay in finland. i also have this plan in case my psych wants to ward me, i’ll be running away from my apartment and staying at this guy’s house who’s 28 and i’ve been talking to him for a few months i think. i don’t even care if i get kidnapped or anything, though i don’t think that will happen. i haven’t seen him in real life yet tho.

I wasn't aware that I had bipolar disorder until a couple years ago, I'm 34. Ive put myself in a lot of bad situations when I was drunk in the past, behaved erratically, did things I regret. I quit drinking about 5 years ago, and I've been able to have some drinks here and there and be fine. 

After what happened on Saturday I know that I'm still an alcoholic and I can't trust myself to know when to stop, or know how I'll react when I'm drunk. 

I was with my family for celebrations on Saturday out at the trailer park I grew up going to. We were having an awesome day, I noticed myself getting irrationally mad/irritable a couple times but just ignored it and continued to enjoy myself. The family I was with has always been big into drinking so when I go visit it's hard for me to resist but I usually do since I quit. Saturday I got carried away, they were pouring shot after shot and I did every one they offered.

At 10 pm there were fireworks and live music, we were having a great time. I don't remember anything after that until I was being wrestled to the ground and handcuffed &amp; taken away in a police car to the hospital. I remember bits and pieces but it was like a dream. We sat in the hospital, with me still in cuffs for several hours, during which I was just being belligerent, yelling at everyone and rambling to the cops. They told me that I threatened to slit my throat with a knife from the kitchen. I had no memory of that. The worst part is my step son was in the house when this happened. I'm so scared that I traumatized him. I might never see him again and I can't even handle the thought of that.

I finally talked to the psychiatrist at the hospital, told him I wasn't suicidal and I couldn't remember what happened and I didn't know why I would do that because I'm not suicidal, I've been taking my meds and trying to build a better life for myself and my family. 

I was finally released and un-cuffed and they dropped me off at my mom's where I've been since. My boyfriend dropped a bag off for me but we haven't talked. He had his son still yesterday and had to talk to him and focus on him. I feel so embarrassed and ashamed. That wasn't me. 

I'm so terrified I'm about to lose everything and I feel so fucking sick to my stomach thinking about what I put everyone through. I've never been handcuffed or put in the back of a police car. I could have hurt or killed myself and I don't want to die. I could have killed myself because I was drunk. 

I just want to go home but I can't. If only I'd stopped drinking when I should've, everything would be fine. But it isn't and I didn't stop. I wanted to be normal so bad, convinced myself I was, but I'm not. 

I don't know why I reacted that way while I was drunk, I don't actually feel that way and it's terrifying. I don't know if I'm going to still have a partner and a step son after this.

He was extremely regretful and had gone to the hospital for 6 days after months in and out of psychosis and delusions. Once out of the hospital he was doing okay, seemed to be in a bit of a mixed episode (calling me sobbing about how he couldn't do it anymore then a few hours later throwing himself into his therapy worksheets and going on about how much he loved me.) He was also going to aa and getting sober.

 He ended up relapsing on adderall the end of March and became delusional again. He gets persecutory and jealous delusions. He decided that I was in a secret relationship and the powerful people out to get him had gotten to me, that I was pretending to work things out to get back at him and string him along while said people watched. He stayed up all night going through my Instagram and decided i was dating a guy who followed me who no one has seen or heard from since 2016 (who I was never involved with). He wrote me a huge message in the morning saying how he prayed he got another chance with me, how he was being set up and knew they got to me, how he loved me and how sorry he was for all the pain he put me through but how he was afraid I was gaslighting him and how that would ""bring negative energy upon my own path"". Said how he felt like our souls had met and when we met like he'd already known me and how at the end or this life or in the next I would see that he ""didn't do these things""

He then blocked me. He's emailed me a couple of times since then now saying he's ""happy for my new relationship"" but that he ""loves and misses me and is crying as he writes this"". He tells me in every email how ""he's being set up by powerful people and how I know his soul and how he would never hurt people or whatever they're going to say he did"". He said he is having trouble getting in to see someone in one email and how he hoped he could soon because he needed to talk to someone-asked me to send him the therapy video links I'd sent him (about bipolar) and then told me not to diagnose him in the same paragraph? He tells me in every email he loves and misses me signs every email with ""love"" gives me updates (saying he's going to all his doctor appointments how he's been clean since the slip up the end of march,, etc) but doesn't ask me at all how I or the dog he loves so much that we shared for the last five and a half years are doing.

He still won't unblock me and now it's been a month since i heard from him. Won't answer me if he's okay and I even just asked him to send me back my stuff, zelled him a bit of money for the shipping and asked just for him to tell me goodbye then so we could both have closure. Nothing. Radio silence. Sent his family the messages he sent me and they said he seemed like he was doing fine (apparently they don't see anything off about him writing that he needed to talk to someone and was being set up by powerful people). Im confused, I'm hurt, I don't know what to think. I cry every day I feel completely discarded like I didn't even warrant a goodbye. His episode last summer he was mean and hateful and had no problem telling me goodbye so I have no idea what is going on. I don't understand why you would tell someone over and over you love them then leave them to worry with no response. Why keep my stuff? Why not even say goodbye? 

He was extremely jealous and afraid that I would find someone else and leave him. He felt like he had nothing to offer after losing his life savings, great career, most of his belongings and ending up living with his parents after his last episode. Now he keeps saying how he knows I'm in a relationship and he's happy for me? It all makes no sense to me at all I'm trying so hard to understand. Has anyone been through anything like this?

Recently my SO had an episode in which they left and lost all feelings for me. This was one of the worst episodes. During this time they stopped taking their meds. They were religiously compliant before. The meds really made a difference and they agreed when they took them. Now I feel they are no longer hypomanic and want to reconcile but they do not want to take the meds due to side effects (something they were ok with while medicated). They also will not try different medication.

I know they will have episodes no matter what but meds make it easier to bounce back quicker and while medicated arguments didn't get far. Unmedicated in the past they were kind of emotionally and verbally abusive to me. I fear this will happen again. But I can't make them take meds. Is there any hope this will work? With no meds and they won't go to therapy? What about brain damage I hear about after episodes? Should I just walk away from this relationship?

This may be more suitable for PTSD and ADHD threads but maybe someone has a similar experience...

I am 33F and was diagnosed with ADHD as an adult. All the symptoms made total sense to me and I had no issue accepting the diagnosis. I have been on stimulants for the last 3 years and my life has turned around. I became organised, managed to complete 2 advanced diplomas, got healthy and stopped partying...

A couple of years ago I got a new job as the Head of HR and Safety. Since the very beginning the company was totally toxic. I experienced screaming in boardrooms, young women being bullied that would come to me often for support, and lots of unethical and intimidating acts by the CEO and CFO towards others. Bit by bit, my power to take action was chipped away and I wasn't able to protect the people I saw getting bullied as I was also being bullied myself. In the midst of the pandemic and dealing with a huge workload, i was running on adrenaline trying to look after everyone that I didn't even notice how bad the treatment I was receiving was.

To cut a long story short, since October I had been back and forth with my boss, the CEO, begging for help, him promising to give me support and then failing. The bullying towards me continued and was also being totally neglected. I have been told by a psychologist and the hospital that I now have PTSD. 

My treating psychiatrist for ADHD diagnosed me differently. He said I had major depressive disorder and general anxiety disorder. He put me on Cymbalta and I was fine on 30mg. When I went up to 60mg, the first couple of days were strange. I woke up and remember thinking that there was a complete absence of negative emotions. I felt high almost. I immediately got in the gym and tried to do the things I used to enjoy. When driving, I started having intrusive thoughts about turning the wheel and driving into oncoming traffic. This scared me so much, that I drove home as carefully as I could and called my mum in tears, not understanding why I was thinking these things. 

After 2 days, these symptoms went away but I felt a mixture of being totally numb, to angry, to depressed, but having extreme anxiety and panic attacks (I was getting this before my dose was upped anyway). At one point in the gym, my heart rate was 180bpm and I was just walking. I was shaking and nearly crying, but trying to push myself to do the suggesting thing and exercise as it's good for mental health.

I went to my doctor a couple of weeks later, told her what happened and she told me I needed to go to the hospital. When I did, they said I was having a rare reaction to the medication, and they lowered my dose. I've felt better since, but still have PTSD symptoms.

When my psychiatrist found out, he told me he thinks I reacted because I have bipolar. I explained to him that I know my emotions are severe and I get upset very easily, but I have never had a low or elevated mood without a trigger. I questioned this myself before my ADHD diagnosis, as I always had very quick mood swings. For example, I would have an argument with my mum, and 30 mins later I would be totally fine. The mood swings never lasted more than an hour and always had a trigger, although my emotional reaction to the trigger was often seen as too much. 

My doctor has now said that he is going to stop my ADHD medication and refuses to listen to my reasons why I don't think bipolar is the right diagnosis. I believe what I have is rejection sensitivity dysphoria which is common in ADHD. 

I was so sure that I didn't have bipolar but now I am starting to doubt my own mind. I've asked my mum and my oldest friend what they think, they don't think I have it either when we have looked at the symptoms. How do I know if I am in denial and if he is right?

I am so scared of being misdiagnosed and forced to go on bipolar medication and come off ADHD meds. They could make me so much worse in the long run if the diagnosis is wrong.

My husband a little bit but not as much as the kids. I haven’t been sleeping as much as I should and my period is due so I don’t even know if the Zyprexa is the culprit but the way I’ve been acting is not normal for me. I do have a psych appointment in a few days.

What’s interesting about this is that there is no build up I’m suppressing or wave of rage I’m fighting. I’m fine and calm until I hear the kids argue or fight or if they ask me a question for the 800th time, even if the question is asked calmly and like kids do, and then I go from 0 to 60 in the blink of an eye.

So, I know irritability and annoyance can be both a depressive or manic symptom. This med has me pretty calmed down so I truly don’t think I’m in an episode. Not to mention I just came out of a hypomania that lasted two months a few weeks ago. Not that that matters but yeah. 

For people who deal with irritability and annoyance on a regular basis, how do you not let this ruin your relationships? It’s gotten to the point where my eldest daughter, who is 9, has said at dinner that I’ve been very rude and not nice and it upsets her. She’s also told my youngest not to bother asking me questions.

Since we have poeple with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder (I am somehow the only one with bipolar) I always knew that I am genetically prone to psychosis and should't smoke. 

In my youth I still tried it because I wanted to know how it is like and I always reacted like you'd imagine. Severe anxiety, delusions of persecution etc. This sometimes even lasted a few days so I never ever enjoyed it so I stopped.

Don't ask me why but I tried it again two days ago. It was actually fine. I didn't feel like it did much to me despite having no short term memory. I had no horror trip like I used to and I wonder if this was due to my meds (wondering if an anti psychotic like seroquel actually would supress this) . Well I was like ""meh. I really don't get it why people like this"" and moved on.

However later that day I realized that my mood became instable. I ended up not sleeping and being kinda  hypersexual. I felt like mania was building up but it wasn't. It was like a short borderline mood peak. After I finally were able to sleep I was lowkey depressed. As the time moved on I became more and more depressed.

I was recently put on cymbalta and lamotrigine during my last psychiatric inpatient hospitalization and felt better than I’ve felt in a long time (after getting off my meds for a few months). Once I got out I was gone until the cymbalta dose was increased. After a week or two I became impulsive although I felt better than I had felt in quite a while. 

I have substance abuse issues and ended up doing a strong substance off impulse. (Idk if i can get banned for talking about the drug itself on here so I won’t). Long story short it became a crisis and i was almost hospitalized due to the state I was in. 

I talked to my psychiatrist and counselor about this incident. My psychiatrist ended up asking me a lot of questions about the abuse and followed up with questions related to mood disorders. she said was concerned with my safety and diagnosis (she hadn’t diagnosed me with MDD, it was previous psychiatrist) and said I might have a substance abuse disorder at the least and bipolar 2. I talked to my biological mother and she explained how she and many others in my family have bipolar among other issues. My psychiatrist wants me to bring my mother to my next appointment, presumably to talk about my symptoms. 

I’m concerned with being misdiagnosed although I’m currently going through a panicky and possibly hypomanic state atm. I’m skeptical that I’m bipolar and I think I’m just paranoid and anxious. My adoptive mother isn’t convinced that I’m bipolar. 

1. I know that no one can diagnose me obviously, i just wanted advice on how to proceed with this in order to not be misdiagnosed. 

2. Also, can bipolar just appear at this age? I’ve struggled for years with ptsd, social anxiety, and depression.

I was first diagnosed with ADHD and depression when I was 12, but I've never had any treatment completely help my symptoms. Doctors would always ask about manic periods and I would just say no. Part of it was because years ago, I knew a girl who was misdiagnosed with bipolar and she warned me against it. But also it didn't sound much like anything I'd ever experienced.

But a few months ago, I was really depressed like usual, and then I suddenly started having more energy. I started a bunch of projects, I just wanted to DO stuff, although I wasn't anymore productive at work. Then I started being unable to sleep. It wasn't that I was deliberately staying up all night, because I know that sleep is important, but I would go to bed and just stare at the ceiling and think and never get more than maybe a light doze all night. But I was still wide awake the next morning. Then a few days later it just went away and I was depressed again. 

I've never experienced anything like that before, so I told my therapist about it and asked her if that was hypomania. She said it sounded a little like that, but I should tell my psych about it when I finally got an appointment. Well, I did get an appointment, but by then I'd kinda forgotten all about it. When the doctor asked about mania, I thought about mentioning it, but it was only that one time, and I wasn't even sure if that's what it had been. So I said no again. (Yeah, I know, dumb.)

Cut to this week. I just added Strattera to my Prozac rx a couple weeks ago. My mood is better, but that's kinda the point of the meds, right? But also I haven't had a few hours sleep in days and I'm still wide awake now. I don't think I'm otherwise acting much different, like I don't think any of the other markers of hypomania fit. I'm distractable, but I'm always distractable (one of the reasons I was diagnosed with ADHD).

I know the answer is that I need to talk to my psych but I won't be able to until Tuesday and I guess the idea of adding another diagnosis (esp one as stigmatized as BP) to my roster makes me pretty nervous...

TLDR: three-year bp2 ride coming to an end.  I believe I've turned a corner. (I *tried* to make this short(er), but every time I scrapped paragraphs, new ones blossomed. If you can get through it, well, god bless ya.)

\--------------------

Last year this week, after a two-year, very bp2 episode (up and down and round and round and sideways and ground down into the center of the earth) that ended with my shit divorce settlement (bc I was crazy at the time); losing 40 pounds (good, but too much, and now skin slack and look so much older – not what a post-divorce woman “of a certain age” wants to exude); not sleeping for months; paradoxical or extreme reactions to meds I’d always taken (e.g. sleep); and having a full-on nervous breakdown - I entered Day 1 of PHP, which basically saved my life.

I was in it for 3 months. (I took the summer off of work – which alone helped me start to chill as I had not stopped working all that time; that I was, in fact, doing overload.) That whole first day, I just sobbed and sobbed. I felt very disoriented, but it really was a soft place to land. I wouldn't have imagined that you could bond and feel close with folks that way – and this was over Zoom!, but we really did, and it was a very special experience, tender, even, a summer “out of time.”

This year has surprised me by being as hard as the previous years although a different hard. I guess I thought all I’d have to do for post-PHP reentry was take it slow, quit multi-tasking, stop myself at 4 from doing my work-that-never-ends, use my tools to get through the anxieties, triggers, overwhelm, etc., and finally be transformed into some enlightened version of myself.  I didn’t know that PHP wasn’t recovery – that was remediation – and that only *after* would I be able to begin to understand what had just gone on, get my nervous system and emotions regulated, and start to deal with some grown-up shit – or anything, really - in a way I never had before.

This entire year I had a lot of grown-up shit to do – left-over divorce stuff, kid stuff (oh, did I tell you I have split custody of a teenager?), clean up some weird stuff due to being insane? I would say that, on average, if I was lucky, I slept 4 hours a night.  I was trying to go back into work 2x week 40 miles away.  (Doing the rest from home.)  I was trying out new meds – with poor results. I was being harassed by my ex – and coming to realize that my 12-year marriage had been psychologically, verbally and emotionally abusive.. I was comparing myself to everyone else who in the last 20 years *built* lives whereas I was just crawling out of the wreckage of a life that didn’t get built and that left me with CPTSD.  I was learning – notably through this site – that it hadn’t been just “run of the mill” divorce craziness, but a full-blown bp2 episode. I felt old and hopeless and lonely as fuck. And the shame and remorse and self-hatred. And the loneliness. And the insomnia.

BUT. 

In the last three weeks, I felt brave enough (and desperate – due to lack of sleep) to try Depakote (while also simultaneously decreasing Lamictal) - and I have indeed begun to sleep more (still with Ambien, sometimes twice).  I’ve now had around five nights of (broken-up) 8 hours! A few of (broken-up) 7, a few of (broken-up) 6. I’ll take those. And, holy shit, I’m like a new person when I have some sleep. (One knows this, but one can’t sleep!)  I can see that I’ve come a ways since last year at this time. Limped a ways. Crawled on the ground drooling and crying. Rocked on my side in an Edvard Munch silent scream. (Have done all those things.)  Yet I recently also started swimming 2-3 times a week.  I’ve done as much acupuncture as I can afford at the nearby clinic bc my nervous system was fucked *up*. And, of late, on a number of occasions, I’ve put on a pretty dress and gone swing dancing – something I hadn’t done since before the marriage, and thought my smile was going to burst through my mask. 

Now, I’m the queen of shoulda woulda coulda, of scouring the past for all the spots where I can berate myself for doing it wrong, where I can rail at the injustice of my treatment – which has just one outcome: me feeling like shit.  So when those loops come I do my best to employ those analog PHP “coping skills” – CBT, DBT, ACT, my EMDR resourcing, etc., tryna shift my mind from the thoughts – like a boxing match with that  echo chamber from hell which is my mind. I wanted to something to help me do this better, so I found this online jewelry store that makes these plain embossed silver and gold bands personalized with whatever notion I determine, and now, when my mind goes: “He got so much of my pension! It’s not fair!” – I touch my *acceptance* ring. When I think, “There’s nothing to live for!”  – I touch my *hope* ring. 

Tomorrow, I may feel bummed anew, and what I’m writing today may feel naïve, but for today, I am grateful that a year has passed since that first day of PHP.  Not saying anything’s perfect or great, but if I’m sleeping, and now with a more robust nervous system, and the Depakote that seems to be working, there’s a foundation for me to rise to the occasion of these challenges. I know that I have to be vigilant about the moods, etc. (which I so was not when the whole thing started. But I do feel like this particular terrible 3-year ride is ending, and that I have entered a new phase. 

My next ring, for my upcoming birthday, will read *forward*. I’ve been planning this fall to walk the Camino de Santiago de Campostela, which is a 500-mile pilgrimage that pilgrims (Catholics and Christians, seekers and spiritual sorts, divorcees just out of mental breakdowns, et al) have been walking for a few thousand years in Northern Spain.

Officially diagnosed Major Depressive Disorder (recurrent) and BPD, with severe symptoms when I was 22.

On Monday I started feeling happy and full of energy, very unusual because I'm always depressed or angry. Definitely felt the compulsion to jump from hobbie to hobbie and activity. Colleagues pointed out I was excelling at work. Then everything culminated yesterday. So this actually transpired within 7 days. Definitely felt irritated the whole time.

Yesterday I just snapped in my room. Felt a rush for euphoria of energy that didn't compare to any drug. And I was disoriented and confused. And I couldn't stop doing my hobbies: writing poems, playing instruments and composing music, I even started painting when I hadn't painted in years. I'm a writer by hobby, I started writing lovely poems and I actually started writing my first novel very vividly for a whole hour non-stop. This probably lasted 12 hours. Then I got so tired from doing so many things at the same time that I just felt asleep. I just woke up feeling normal but shaken. I also wrote a lot of things that don't make sense at all.

While this was happening I was gone, completely detached from reality, I was just doing stuff non-stop. There were moments where I came back to my senses and realized something was wrong, and got extremely frightened every time I came to my senses.

Now, does this sound like mania or hypomania to you? This is important to me, I have discuss this with my main psychiatrist and he always thinks I'm exaggerating. I'm already supposed to take the same meds as a bipolar person (I got BPD, our meds overlap, I'm supposed to be taking Valproic Acid and Quetiapine just like you). But I also take anti-depressants, been doing it for years with no problem. And I see bipolars usually don't take them.

I've never been the kind of person who goes around saying they have illnesses without having a diagnosis, but I've recently started to suspect I might be somewhat bipolar... I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder (a very extreme one). After being in treatment for so long and having noticed I always seem to relapse, I'm starting to think there might be more to the equation than an anxiety disorder. If my suspicions are valid, I will discuss them with my psychiatrist. Here's why I suspect I might be bipolar:
- I've recovered many times from my anxiety disorder but I always seem to relapse badly, even when on medication and therapy;
- I often have really bad anxiety crisis where I'm depressed, unmotivated, tired, irritable, I sleep poorly,  I have tons of physical symptoms, etc.
- After those crisis (that could last months or a week), I tend to have a period of greater activity... I feel like trying new hobbies, picking up old projects, traveling, partying, I'm very creative, can't stop talking and making jokes (but for some reason still might feel sad or super irritable).
- After this period of greater joy... I know a bad crisis will come. I just know. In highschool it seemed I was in a different mood each year. It went 1.adventurous, 2.anxious and depressed, 3. party all day, each mood corresponding to a year. Even my physical appearance changed drastically each year. When I went to college this sort of cycle continued, but it seemed anxiety and depression had took the leading role.
- Here's an example of how this cycle affects my life. In the beginning of the semester I was super motivated with college. I would participate in every class, I applied for the Erasmus+ program, I socialized with new people, I got involved in a volunteering program, I started having German lessons, I got super into going on dates and meeting a compatible person, I was working out, etc. all while crying from stress regularly and feeling super on edge, though. A few months forward I was skipping class, skipping exams, avoiding people, I cancelled my Erasmus application, I was anxious and flat out sad, and felt so down and unmotivated I couldn't even care about any of this.
- My irritability is definitely a problem... I often feel like I do a complete 180 when I'm irritated, I don't look like myself anymore... I feel exhausted, confused, guilty and apathetic after I'm done with an irritability episode.
Do you think these are legitimate signs of bipolar that I should discuss with my psychiatrist? Thank you.",True,False,False,BipolarReddit,t5_2qzru,71131,public,self,Could I be Bipolar?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/vpquvz/could_i_be_bipolar/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,

I’m getting good sleep which seems like a good sign that this is authentic stability.

The combo that has helped achieve this is 400mg of Seroquel, 200mg of Lamictal, and 1800mg of Gabapentin (for social anxiety). 

However, I also am diagnosed with OCD and Body Dysmorphic Disorder, the latter being a debilitating obsession about my skin. And holy shit the acne from Lamictal is terrible, I have cysts all over my face, neck, and back. 

But now that Im in my early 20s, I usually get acne pretty rarely. But now it’s worse than it was in high school, and I can’t take it anymore. I had a similar reaction to Lithium when I was 18 which I read is common, I would flush it down the toilet and become manic.

I really cant take it, I really tried giving it a chance it’s fucking me up mentally. I can’t stay on this.Thing is I cant tell what is helping the bipolar depression more: the Seroquel or the Lamictal.

I really don’t think it’s… safe(?) to be on multiple antipsychotics, so I was wondering what else can help me in case the Seroquel isn’t enough for the depression. I’ve been on Depakote with Zyprexa, and although the depression was still awful I’ve read a few studies arguing for its slight antidepressant properties, which has me wondering if it’s enough in conjunction with the antidepressant effects of Seroquel. I was on Trileptal briefly but then my new doctor said it “wasn’t good” so idk if it helps or not.
