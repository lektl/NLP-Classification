What to eat, what jobs to apply for, how to react to confrontation/conflict, what you do after work, what time you go to bed at night, etc, etc, etc. 

All your decisions are based on your genetics and your upbringing.  Some people are morning people, and as such, they wake up early, and probably go to bed early.  They have benefits to that such as feeling better when they clock into their 8-4 job.  Feeling better makes you a more pleasant person which may get you favor with the boss and get you a promotion.  

Everything affects everything else.  The butterfly effect.  If you have a family member die, some people are hardly affected by it and can carry on like normal.  Others are devastated and can't keep their life together for months or even years.  So much in life is about luck and how you react to situations.  Reactions and decisions that are influenced by your past experiences.  

It's just unfair as fuck that I have to live this life that I really had no say in living.  The person you become is largely dependent on how you're raised, that's a fact.  I didn't choose who raised me, I didn't choose my genetic make up and my predisposition to clinical depression.  I didn't choose to grow up as a passive young man that becomes a passive adult man.

A little backstory, I'm now a 35yo male and I've been dealing with severe depression and anxiety my entire life and for the most part can sometimes cope with it, there are however times it begins to get to be too much and I can't stop those thoughts I might even hurt myself just to try and make the pain go away.. it hurts so much my heart feels like it's going to explode.. for most of my friends and family they have no idea because I'm able to mostly hide it when I'm with them but for those closest to me for example my husband it hurts even more to see how it effects them.

My husband has never had anxiety but I can see how it effects him, he's never dealt with depression but he lives in fear not knowing if I'll be alive the next morning. He's one of the only reasons I don't kill myself but it's a struggle every day.. I still cut myself as a way to relieve some of my pain, yes ironic I know, pain to relieve pain, but cutting myself gives me at least some form of relief even if temporary..

I was on meds for a while that helped mostly with the depression but they lost their effect and it's kinda gone downhill the last few months, they screwed up my insurance so I don't currently have a doctor and can't see anyone until the 18th of August.. I'm getting sued over an accident from 4 years ago because the other parties insurance failed to pay one of the bills, my car literally just broke down after I had the same issue fixed 2 years ago..

To kick things off, I have had issues with depression since middle school. The constant thoughts of suicide never left and it never will despite the amount of medications I’ve been taking. Now that I’m nearly an adult that’s supposed to start my sophomore year in college, I still have these thoughts. It’s especially more relevant now as I’ve failed most if not all of my classes last semester.

I hate that I’m bringing this up now. I’ve buried this ever since I got the email from my campus that I wasn’t allowed to come back until next spring. I know what I did wrong. I choose to mope around in my room thinking about another life. I choose to procrastinate during finals because I couldn’t bear the fact I was going to fail anyway. I thought maybe when I got to college things would’ve looked up for me.

Depression is a serious disease. Maybe I’m okay with it. I genuinely don’t know, I’ve had a good life, good friends, good family, literally anything. But I’m just not happy at all even before I failed college. It was always just me laughing to hide all of this.

Its not because I’ve failed my classes that made me retreat to a self pity bottomless pit. It was the fact that I was reminded by myself. Reminded of who I was and always will be. Even if I managed to get myself back into classes, how do I know that this won’t happen again? You can’t just drop out. What would your parents think?

I understand that you don’t have to be in college. You can still succeed in life without it, I’m sure if I did tell me parents everything that’s going on they would understand. Something won’t let me. For weeks now I’ve done the same thing. Work, hop on my computer, sleep, get up, eat, and work all under my parents roof.

[I hope my age dont make it sound childish or edgy/emo,really,it isnt my intent]

I think this is gonna be long.

As I was saying, I hate my life.

Let's start with school...

After middle school, me and my parents agreed on parental education,(looking back,that was probably the worst decision I ever made),at the time was the best decision we could make,my parents are very occupied with work and the nearest school was at 20km (12,42 miles)and there arent bus or other thing in my fucking small village.

Basicaly,here were im living parental education is like this:all the year you study alone at home,and on June you take an exam for entering the next class.

Useless to say that I failed...ok,thats on me...I severely understimated the thing...cant blame anyone but me.

The thing that surprised me the most was how the prof talked to me,they said some nasty thing like:""you really suck at this"" ""change school"" ""you dont have a future"".

The next year I studied really hard,just to hear on June that I couldnt take the exam because I didnt made any presence at school....like...HOW THE FUCK IM SUPPOSED TO MAKE PRESENCE ON PARENTAL EDUCATION!

We take that year to rest,this summer Im supposed to restart school to earn the highschool diploma in 2 years.

The problem is that I lost all the interest in school,I dont even know what I should study.

I dont have a talent,nothing special,a dream, nothing at all...

Changing topic another thing I really hate is that I'm alone...in the past years I was still in contact with some friends from middle school...but this years they just disapeared,no more text o call just puff now they are gone...

But I can understand,who would want to be friend with a fucking fat pig like myself?....yeah....no one...

I'm a total inept who can't do anything on his own,probably I can blame this on my mom (love her,but she has some problem ngl),she is very protective, I could never do something alone.

Now I'm scared of doing anything alone, will I be able? Will I do something stupid? Will I fail?

That kind of thoughs....

If these are the premises,I honestly don't see a future for me either...

The things that I used to enjoy are losing appeal,for example I was a great reader...but I think its almost a year that I dont read a book...games are becoming less enjoyable too...one of my last happy place is reddit, or the internet in general.

I dont honestly see why I should keep living my shitty life,heck the only thing I was really looking forward was a game that came out today,thats honestly really sad....

The only thing I'm really good at is sitting in my room looking at the wall listening to eurobeat wondering how the fuck I messed my life this bad...all of this at 3 A.M.

I think I'm kinda dead inside...I'm detached from the world,from my parents,I tend to lose my cool and peace way more easily than I did in the past.

I honestly don't feel anything anymore...

I even started taking anti depression pil,stealing them from my mom stock...I take 7/8 pills per week,one day I even took 7 pill all together...puked my soul....but I'm still alive...

I dont really care if someone read this/understand me,but I needed to let it out,I already tried writing this kind of post but always deleted them.

But pls dont say that the future is mine and I can be whatever I want,when I was a kid I wanted to be a F1 driver or some kind of racer but we all know that is not gonna happen.

A lot has happened to me since the beginning of the year. I have held everything in for so long and I wanted to vent and not feel like a monster. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I first started college in 2020, I joined the AFROTC program (a college military program) with my best friend and was in it for nearly two years. It was one of the most rewarding decisions of my life as I met some of the most amazing people on earth and learned many life lessons that I will use for the rest of my life. Every week I felt like I accomplished something and it felt euphoric. It was amazing seeing myself grow as a person. However, I was dropped from the program for medical reasons and could not continue. I felt as if my dreams died that day and every day after I was in states of either numbness or sadness for a very long time. It crushed me to leave the program and I would wake up feeling as if I had nothing. I truly wanted to stay.

&amp;#x200B;

Looking back at the months before joining the program I was in a rough spot. COIVD made my life hell on earth as I was couped up in my room for months becoming more and more depressed and driving to a dead-end job. I was gaining so much weight and doing little to nothing in my life. I was going nowhere fast.

&amp;#x200B;

I did not enter the program on the right foot, however. When I first started the program, I left out other medical information, such as being an inpatient at a behavior hospital and self-harming as a teen. I knew if I revealed that information, my dream would have died there. So I didn't say anything. I suppose I did do it for selfish reasons. I thought about how joining the program would help me get a good job and cool experiences. But after a while, my feelings about the program changed. I could've cared less about what job I got and where I went. After a while, I cared so much more about the people I was training with and soon cherished learning and growing with them, especially my best friend. I love those guys like family. I suppose I felt guilty for lying even though I believe it changed my life for the better.

&amp;#x200B;

A couple of months after leaving the program, I wound up in the hospital due to a ruptured appendix and nearly died. I was there for around eight days and I felt mixed emotions ranging from being numb and scared to sad and alone. What made the situation ten times worst was the fact that my best friend, who went to college with me and did the ROTC program, did not show up to see me during those eight days. A Part of me wants to give them the benefit of the doubt. Maybe it would've been too much to see me sick and dying, hooked up to an IV and a heart monitor. Maybe they would've broken down in tears. But part of me believes that when I left the program, part of our friendship died too and that they moved on. It made me feel empty. It made me resent and hate them. I love that person like a sibling. I suppose I'm trying to convince myself that everything we went through and did matter. That it wasn't all for nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm honestly not 100 percent sure of why I am making this post, I feel ashamed for lying to try and get a better life and for hating someone who loves me. I feel sad that my dream died and that I have to find a plan B and that I nearly died.

Finally was able to label  myself as chronic depression and anxiety. I refuse to take meds and right now really tired of me always being the one that needs changing or compromising. Been in and out of therapy since preschool. I had anger issues for no apparent reason. I grew up fairly normal upper-middle class-def not privileged though. I have an older brother I was never close with and 2 loving parents that are still married. I have been incredibly fortunate with opportunity I have created and been presented with. I attempted suicide/successful cry for help in 7th grade. It’s been a life of ups a downs relatively speaking-no significant trauma but for my journey somewhat torturous. I got in a lot of trouble as a kid/teen. I am intelligent just not smart. I have never really done more than experiment with weed. Alcohol and really binge drinking was a problem. I didn’t do it often but when I drank I was “full send”. I don’t drink at all anymore and really haven’t been “drunk” for 10 years? maybe.  Anyway long lead up I know and I’m sorry. Somewhat hopeful this will be cathartic in some way….was told by my boss that I’m going to be fired if things don’t get better. I run a local branch for a large distribution company. I have 60+ employees and responsible for $60 mil in business. Apparently half my team doesn’t like me or is indifferent. I am not happy and my boss knows I am frustrated and basically said “maybe this isn’t the job for you” which at this level means, “eh, I’m thinking about when to fire you if you don’t leave soon.” My career has been a pattern: I quit before I get fired or I get fired.  Since I started working in 1996, I have worked for 9 companies and been fired or agreement to leave 2x and ran 3 times with the last 4 being fired, left but really was running from something not to something, fired, and now at risk. I was already looking but the money is really good and frankly ball my moves have cost us money and savings. I am never going to be able to retire. My behavior and thus situation is a manifestation of my own misery. Haven’t had sex with my wife in over 6 months? I know she loves me but def isn’t in love anymore. She blames it on my moods and the kids and just being tired. All legit. But I think somewhere I am driving her away because I don’t want to be with anyone. And I mean anyone. I would never abandon my kids but if o could live alone in Alaska like one of those shows,I might like it.  Damn this is getting long so if you’ve read this far thank you. Be it morbid curiosity, wanting to cut me down, or truly caring thank you. So here I am. I don’t want to die but man I am tired of this life and just want out and to be left all alone or able to do, say, and act any way I want. I want to be emotionally detached and naked.

So I (23F) have recently graduated college with a bachelor's in biology. I had planned to get into pharmacy school, however, it no longer seems like a path I want to take anymore. I don't know what to do with my life and my parents still believe that I am planning on becoming a pharmacist still. But if I'm being completely honest I only ever chose to pursue pharmacy, and college even, was that it seemed like the only path they would ever allow me to take. I live with them at the moment and I'm looking for work in the mean time under the guise of taking a break. 
I have always been depressed, overly anxious, and tend to have intrusive thoughts of suicide. Since I was about 9 I can remember always wanting to die or at least not exist anymore. The simplest things have always caused me much mental turmoil and the way some members of my family have treated me always made me feel like a burden. Somewhere inside of myself I know tha in their own way they care, but the idea of telling anyone how bad my ideation has gotten recently feels impossible. 
Almost everyday now I cry before bed and try to think of what I can do to make life better. I know that living on away from my family improved my mental heath, but being isolated deteriorates my ability to interact with people and increases my social anxiety.  Additionally rising costs of living make it seem as though I'll be stuck here forever. I want to move out desperately, but no jobs are calling back and working for minimum wage will ensure I really never save enough to leave. 
My father consistently reminds me of how lazy and weak I am and I can't help but believe it sometimes. When he berates me I can't help but thinking about how all my negative thoughts and feelings would dissipate if I was dead. I am weak, I cry whenever I try to be honest with my feelings, I cry when I feel helpless, I cry when I get anxious, I cry when people don't understand, I'm crying now. What I hate the most about these dumb fucking tears is that I do everything in my power to hide them from him and everyone else. Noone has seen me cry since I was a teenager. 
I try to remind myself that I lived a privileged life, that I'm lucky to have all that I do. I really am. I'm a child of immigrants who hadn't a dime to their name and live very cozy. I have no excuse to feel so sad. I just don't get it. People get up everyday living shifty lives for the hell it and are happy do it again. I live comfortably and have to think of reasons to not end it all. 
 I don't know what I want to do, who I want to be, or why I want to be here. I feel like a waste. Someone else could have been born and done something with this life. I know I'm wasting it and can't seem to stop it. 
What should I do? I've tried changing the way I think, but I always know that nothing I do matters. We all go eventually, why does it matter if it's today or a century from now?

My bf sat me down today and told me that I seriously need help. I'm starving myself without realizing, I'm in tears every other day, and I have been warned of getting fired due to lack of effort.

I know I have severe social anxiety although it feels cringe for me to admit it. I've been seeing a psychiatrist in hopes that meds can fix my racing thoughts and unbalanced emotions.

The reason I'm so broken is because I was sexually harrassed by someone within my friend group, hid it for a year to avoid conflicts, and when I finally got the courage to speak up, nothing was done about it. That person continues to be welcomed like nothing happened. I still hold close ties to some of those friends, but they still hang out with the other half, and understandably so. But then I feel like I'll get left behind someday, that they'll come to the decision that I was overreacting. I'm really really scared of losing my friends. They have saved my life and I love them very dearly, even the ones I lost.

It's been two years since this all started. For these two years I've been telling myself that it's not me and that things will get better. The problem is me putting way to much importance to what my friends and social groups think of me to the point where I treat the friend group as a full time job.

I am an extremely empathetic person and very socially anxious. I always try my best to help everyone as much as I can. This lack of action made me feel like I'm not important enough or my word doesn't hold enough weight to do anything about it.

I was diagnosed with bipolar depression when I was 16 I'm 19 now and my depression has only gotten worse. I haven't finished high school and I'm overweight with no job or girlfriend. I don't blame the world for all this I blame myself. I planned on killing myself when I was in sophomore year of high school because of all the stress school had me in. I had cuts all over my wrists but I covered them up with a jacket I always had on. A girl in my Spanish class noticed my cuts but I just told her I got them when I was helping my dad with this old Ford truck he has in the backyard. She somehow believed the lie and that was that. I started ditching school that same year. I would not go for days at a time. Only going probably twice a week. It got bad. That was when my parents took me to see a psychiatrist and that's when we found out about my condition. I didn't have a ruff childhood so when I found out I had bipolar depression it came to me as a surprise. My mom has it but at the time I didn't know mental illnesses can be hereditary. They proscribed me meds for my mood swings but they didn't work. At first I didn't want to take them I didn't want to take something that makes me think and feel a certain way. I wanted to stay me. My parents took me to a new psychiatrist and he proscribed me heavier doses of anti-depressants. I took them and still I feel the same way. I felt depressed, angry, confused and scared that nothing would help me. So I started smoking weed. I know it's probably not a good idea to mix weed and meds but I was so tired of feeling angry and sad all the time I just had to. My meds don't help with anything so I've been the same depressed fuck for the last three years of my life. I've gained so much weight I don't look like the same person anymore. Girls don't talk to me and when they do they try to end the conversation as soon as possible. I don't blame them I look like a dangerous person. Not in a way that they are intimidated by me but in a way that creeps them out. I mean I am a slob with a nun kept neckbeard and curly hair. Recently me and friends went to go see the new Doctor Strange movie and one of them took his girlfriend. I noticed she would always try to keep a distance away from me. She would also talk to every other person but me. It bothers me that everyone in my friend group has done something important like get into a good university or getting lucky with crypto. I'm still here in high school because of my mistakes and have no job because I have no diploma. My parents think very little of me. My dad saw me playing Call of Duty MW and literally told me ""You better not go crazy like those who shoot up places"". I didn't say anything because my dad's the last person I want to have a fight. It hurt me and I just sat there looking at the floor after a while I turned off the Playstation. The rest of the day I just kept thinking about what he said to me. My dad really thinks I could end up like a fucking monster. My mom is tired of my bullshit as well. The last year or so I've been having mental breakdowns. Almost every week or two me and my mom get into shouting matches. It always ends up with me on the floor crying wishing for death, telling my mom why she gave birth to me and making a big sense. My parents have done nothing about my mental breakdowns. For a year or so this had been happening and taking me to a hospital probably never crossed there mind. In fact when I was younger my parents completely neglected the idea that something might me wrong with me. Aunts, Uncles, teachers and even the school counselor told them to take me to get help.

&amp;#x200B;

4 years ago, I finished my second year of medical school and came back home to prepare for the first USMLE exam. My academics were great, but that was about it. 

I came back home burned out. I was part of a church community at the school, where people were racist. They were so excited to give gifts of appreciation to students who weren't Asian. (Black, white, hispanic... they were all appreciated.) But when it came time for my class to graduate from the basic sciences and go onto rotation, the church community decided no appreciation was needed because the two people leaving the community were Asian. 

I had devoted so much to care for that community. I felt betrayed. I thought I'd feel better if I went back home and found a place among my own people. I went to a church of my own ethnicity, but I was treated like an invisible person in 2 separate churches. I tried so hard to get myself acquainted with new people at those churches, but no matter how hard I tried, they won't let me into their group. At one church, I was purposefully ignored. They knew they had a new comer but won't even give a nod of acknowledgement that I even existed. Instead, they stared at their phones on purpose, just so they could ignore that I was even there. 

Maybe it's trivial. It probably is trivial as a matter of fact. But it hurt a lot. I thought Christians were supposed to be caring, if not at least a bit welcoming. Instead I was met with ignorance, racism, and criticism (people at my med school church community were against my every opinion when I was their leader. They gave me such hard time when I was trying to get the community working after a hurricane.)

So, I came back hurt from school and also from the new churches that I tried out at home. I fell into worse depression. I couldn't concentrate on my studies at all. On top of that, my mother and her spouse kept fighting loudly in my house. 

Her spouse had an anger issue. He would emotionally and verbally abuse her for no reason at all. My mom would never let me intervene saying it was none of my business. Since I was in middle school, I watched my mom get abused. The fight was one-sided because she didn't speak good English but he did. I watched my mom lose when she did nothing wrong. I wasn't allowed to do anything about it, and that drove me nuts. 

Back to the subject of their fights, once the fight was over, my mom was always irritable and she would take her emotions on me and my little sister. She denies doing so, but I remember very clearly what she did. She'd find things about us that she didn't like and would lecture us for 2-3 hours. She'd say demeaning things about me, telling me that all these bad qualities are from my damnable biological father. She'd insult my character and bring out my past mistakes, while forbidding me to say anything back to her. If at any chance she let me say anything, she'd say that I was always wrong, that my opinions were worth nothing because I'm unable to form coherent logical thoughts on my own.

At first, I put efforts into explaining myself. As time went on, I realized that it was no use trying to 'communicate' to my mom. 

I couldn't tell her that I was burned out, or that I was deeply hurt, because my mom didn't knew how to listen. 

I kept pushing the exam, unable to concentrate due to my emotional disorder. I stopped talking to my mother, since I found it impossible to make her hear me. Once, I wrote her a letter of apology after a fight with her. She ripped it without reading it and threw it down the trash. 

Time kept going until I was a year out of my 2nd year of med school. I couldn't push it anymore. I only had 1 month left to take this exam. (Couldn't delay after that 1 month.) 

That's when I decided to try to put myself back together. I decided that for that last month, I would like to move out to a room on my own, where I am free from their fights, mother's constant criticisms, and all my other stress. There wasn't a lot of time. I started packing my bags first, so once I find a place, I can move out immediately and start studying.

However, in the middle of my packing, my mother arrived. She began screaming how bad daughter I was for trying to ""LEAVE THE HOUSE FOREVER"". I tried to explain that I wanted to find a place to study. She won't let me finish my sentence, kept yelling hysterically, and that's when I knew I wasn't going to reach her. 

I kept silent as she ordered me to pack everything including my books and notes in 2 hours. I did as I was bid to do, since there was no option at that point. Once everything was packed, the luggage went into the trunk of the car. My mom drove me to the community recycling depot. I didn't understand what she wanted to do at first. Like... why drive me to the recycling depot?

When the car came to a stop, I finally found out what she was up to. 

She said,

""Fine. If you want to leave the house and give up on your career, get off the car and throw all your books and notes into those bins. Then I'll drop you off at a train station and you can do whatever you want. Otherwise, we're going back to our house where you'll study for that exam.""

There was no way I could studying in that house. The moment she said that, I felt all hope leaving me. All of my dreams and effort to reach that point in my education shredded into dust. I grabbed my books as numbness settled in everywhere and trashed all of my scribbles and postnotes, textbooks, EVERYTHING. 

My mom looked really surprised when I did that. She picked up everything and got it back into the car. Then she began to drive me to the train station where she threatened to dump me forever. 

During the car ride, she said that she was going to stop my card so I won't be able to take out any cash at all. She was going to leave me at the train station with my luggage. She said that things will never turn out like I (supposedly) planned this estrangement to be. She said I'd at best become a prostitute on the street because that's all I could become outside the safety of her care. 

When I heard my mom saying out loud that, after all these years, she thought I'd just become a prostitute if I left medical school and tried to become independent on my own traumatized me. I became extremely numb inside and out. I experienced 'depersonalization', where I felt like I was partly outside the body watching things happen in a third person point of view. 

In the end, she only drove me there and came back because she apparently never intended to throw me out. But the damage of her words and actions were profound. 

I was so shocked and in pain that I kept crawling into the closet after locking all the doors to my room. I huddled myself in there, replaying that car ride over and over again. Hurts from the past that I didn't mention here also came back. It probably seems trivial to some people reading this, but I was traumatized beyond recovery. I couldn't feel anything except for fear, extreme sadness, and anger. 

My personality completely changed from that point. I became irritable, always angry, and withdrawn at the same time. I used to never give up on anything, but now I give up an everything if things start to get even a bit difficult. 

I'm rebellious to everything my mother says. I withdrew myself from most of my friends. I couldn't perform well on my clinical rotations because I couldn't find myself able to study at a desk for long before emotions took over and I was huddled in my blanket, trying to fight my worthlessness that was instilled into me that day. 

I did pass the first USMLE exam, but it was a bad pass. I only got maybe 1 week of real studying done. With the score I got, my dream of becoming a surgeon was officially off the table. I didn't want to become a family physician or anything else. I felt resentment at the fact that I lost the opportunity forever because I let my mother affect me so much. My dream shattered for good when I got that score report. I became more depressed.   

During the clinical rotation, I often found myself wanting to jump into a busy highway to kill myself. No one found out at the hospital or anywhere else, because I'm good at putting on a facade. Besides, no one in my life ever took the time to listen to what I had to say. Why tell anyone when even my family failed to understand me?

Regardless, I finished the third year rotation (somehow), and came back home to study for the 2nd exam. But since I lost my motivation to study, I kept failing the mock exam. I failed 6 times.

After my 6th failure, I couldn't take it anymore. I didn't see any hope, but I couldn't decide if I should leave medical school. So, I submitted a leave of absence to my school, hoping to buy time to think things through. I also ignored all the emails I was getting from my school since. 

My mother had apologized for that incident since it had happened. But I always tell her that the damage is done. My personality is ruined to the point that I'm not the same person anymore. I give up so easily that it's ridiculous. I'm ashamed of everything I am. Every time I try something new, I give up in the beginning because I keep thinking that all I can and will ever become on my own is some damn prostitute out on the street. (which is irrational, but it gets me all the time.) 

Since submitting the LOA, I thought about what I could do instead of medicine, but I can't seem to find anything that would not leave me feeling resentful and wanting to kill myself for giving up on medicine. At the same time, I can't find the motivation to keep myself going with medicine.

I'm so close to graduating. I only have maybe 6 months of rotations left and 2 major exams before my MD degree. But, I know I won't make it through those two exams. Multiple failures at the mock tells me so. I have no confidence in getting a proper reference letter from my supervising doctors. I don't think anyone will be willing to write a strong recommendation for a person like me. 

So, I do need to quit, but I don't know what I'm gonna do to myself if I really do end up giving up on this long dream that I persevered. 

Just last night, I was really close to swallowing 100 pills of aspirin extra strength, which will put me over the lethal dose and will surely kill me. But my Christian upbringing stopped me from carrying out the act, because I don't want to end up in hell for killing myself. 

I'm just hopeless and needed a place to rant.

My father was recently diagnosed with Covid, and it has been rough. He, like my grandfather before him (and myself I guess), gets into the habit of only looking at things in the worst light, unable to see the other side. This has become more of an issue as of late as I have had to console him when his depression gets bad and he begins to cry, because he feels bad, is worried about his health, and can’t see the future where he is better, and as such my duties as a caretaker during his sickness have increased tenfold. When he gets like this, I start to panic, and in turn it makes my anxiety spike and my depression following worsen. This was never something I expected to happen, and definitely not something I am prepared to deal with.

I am his support system, as well as my grandfathers, my sisters, and my moms. Each has their own issues, and each comes to my for support(not me entirely, but they always come back to me). I don’t want to be their support systems. Why do I have to support them when I myself am not structurally stable (I thought hard about that one). I want to move, but am in a position where i literally cannot for at least another year and a half to a year.

I’m a 4/10 my friend is a 8/10 and the girl we both like is a 7/10. Right off the bat the girl is going to like my friend because he is very attractive. She won’t even consider me as an option and she will never get to find out my personality since she will never even bother to take me seriously.

The fact I have to the go the gym everyday and put my body through sheer amount of pain just for a woman is also insane to me 

And im gonna do all this just so I can tie with my friend with an attractive face. Like I put blood , sweat and tears into this just to tie with a guy who was born handsome. And let’s not forget half the reason she even likes me is because of my money, the other half is what sculpted my body to be like. 

None of what she likes is actually me at my core

And let’s not forget my friend could also go to the gym,get rich,have a great personality. So that could make my whole “transformation” worthless In the end anyways.

And btw I’m not saying going to the gym and getting money is bad.

In my head love is when someone loves u for u but if you’re ugly ain’t no one pretty going to love you for you at your core. They’ll love your body, your money, your cars etc but when that’s all gone there is no love . So Yh I don’t think I believe in love

I had a girlfriend which we dated for 3 years. Then she broke up with me. I remember her telling me to “stop whining and crying about” depression and past events whenever the topic came around. She was the first person, who was not a professional, who I told my problems to.

Maybe I wrote this as a call for help, maybe for ranting. I honestly don’t know. 3 terms and 5 years, then I’m gonna leave my country. Go somewhere else.

My family is kind of dis functional, but we love each other and are financially comfortable. I go to one of the best colleges in the world and have a good GPA. I’m in the middle of a depressive episode right now. I’ve had anxiety for a couple of years but it’s progressed into depression. 

At the height of my anxiety, I woke up my parents almost every morning and cried while refusing to go to school. I would cry before exams and just stress about everything. I went to therapy. My parents were really accommodating but I guess it got too much for them and at some point, my mom burst out and said that I’m exhausting her and she can’t keep doing this. She apologised for this a couple of months later but since then I’ve never felt comfortable asking for help with panic attacks or depressive periods. I just feel like a burden. 

During this ongoing episode, I’m living with my brother. We just had a huge fight because he booked a trip to go visit our parents and it’s tomorrow but I don’t want to go. A big part of my depression is my lack of identity and purpose, and how useless I feel. I can’t make decisions because I’ve never really had to. I’ve always listened to what my parents have to say. At college, I’m too busy keeping grades up to deal with setting healthy habits to stop these episodes. My brother did this to help me, but I told him that I’d rather reimburse him and use the time that he’s away to find myself and get a sense of who I am while away from family and college and work. After a long conversation, he told me that I refuse to take help from people who are offering and that I will not do anything in the time that he will be away and that I exhaust him.

When I was young, I was physically and emotionally abused by my parents and aunt and uncle. They all are very religious people but everyone in my family including my relatives deal with anger issues and other things like anxiety and addiction. I was bullied and teased by everyone and even got rocks thrown at me. They used to make fun of my weight and quarrel with me. I was also molested at a young age by an old man I knew. I became very self aware of how I sit or talk around men (I used to get nightmares and depressive episodes from flashbacks.) At 15, I got diagnosed with Bulimia Nervosa, MDD psychotic features, PTSD, and Social anxiety (My family figured out about my cutting and sent me to a psychiatric ward.) 
There was a doctor who told me I had BPD traits but told me that I wasn't old enough to diagnose. When they described what BPD was, I felt like I finally found a answer to my problems and I cried like a baby. But my other doctor diagnosed with me with what I have right now. 

Most BPD traits that have been present throughout my life was fear of abandonment and rejection (I would get very jealous, very anxious, and so angry at everyone and cry to myself. I started arguments, drama, and pushed everyone away and ghost them.) 

I always had unstable relationships with everyone, my friends have called me a bitch and narcissist. They would turn away from me but come back when I apologized constantly. I also had a favorite person which was one of my friend, but my inferiority complex just made me push her away. I couldn't trust her anymore because she always spent more time with her other friends. I'm suspicious of people's actions or words whenever they talk with me. My exes all had to deal with me always asking for reassurance or constantly trying to stop me from breaking up with them. I was also obsessive and made sure they kept touch with me. (I broke up with this one girl for 4 times and I kept going back to her. I felt like I just admired her though. But when I found out she liked her bff, I felt empty the whole 2 days and it just went by and I felt okay again. But I hold a grudge on her still.) 

I'm very impulsive and passive aggressive around people I don't know or don't want to associate with. Even my family members and my friends tell me that I have an attitude and they don't know why my mood shifts so much. I also have opened a car door in a high way because I was pissed at my dad, I ran away from home, I have gotten physically aggressive with people trying to help me, and I even tried to drive a car to kill myself. I've hurt animals like my two cats that are re-homed now. I used to kick them and shout at them and I accidentally almost stabbed them when I was dissociating. And I have killed baby birds when I'm angry or depressed.

I also have a poor self image, I always change my future goals, my wants and needs, who I am in the mirror or in person are always changing. It feels like I have no passion and my sexual identity or who I want to be friends with changes. I feel guilty for going against different moral rules and I get such a big stress thinking about everything. 

I always feel empty, I feel like I shouldn't exist, no one will ever love me or be by my side. I find everything useless and I'm just nihilistic when I do.
I have also made suicidal threats when I was in my middle school days. My dad had to break the bathroom window to stop me. And I have stopped taking my medication. I was on Prozac and I feel like it had helped me with my nightmares and appetite. I was also taught DBT skills but I don't use them (my anger or other emotions can't be controlled. I just lose my shit so quickly. And swing at anything and anyone.) My psychiatrist wants me on another medication but I'm going to try therapy first. So if therapy doesn't work, I'm gonna be on a medication that lessens my anger impulsivity. So this is the end, I'm sorry if it's so long.

I don’t feel like people take me serious or care about me. They only care at bars/parties because I’m the life of the party, but I’m only the life because I’m drinking my depression away. I don’t drink every night, not even every weekend — to just prevent having a drinking problem. 

At work, I feel like I’m not taken serious. I sometimes feel like I’m not liked. At my performance review, I was reassured that  my bosses love me, but they gave me some constructive feedback to be less of a jokester during our weekly meeting. Bascially, the meeting is to just catch up with everyone. It’s not super business related. I really like to talk to people there (it’s online, i work from home) because I’m so lonely but don’t want to reach out to anyone.

I have people to turn to but I don’t know who I can trust.  I don’t want to open up to my guy friends.

Today was the first day I've felt good and it all got dragged down with yelling and being treated less than human. I do my best for people and hardly help myself and I know that's extremely unhealthy. This post is undoubtedly self-centered but I'll cut myself a break because I hardly ever take the time to help myself other than selfmedicate. I don't know what to do right now, I'm just waiting for the cooldown period as usual. Understand that I'm not demonizing anyone with any mental illnesses, it's just really hard dealing with the shit today and I know it's not just BPD by itself. I had a full on anxiety attack crying and hoarse voice in my kitchen and I don't know. I want to get my shit together and actually make something of myself but I honestly don't know how. I wanna move out on my own, get a good job, but I've just been cruising between cigarettes, weed, depression, and whatever joy I can find in fiction. I'm kinda bearing my soul I just beg not to insult me, I already know I'm a loser but I'm trying to fix that about myself. I don't even know what i expect out of posting here. I just have nobody else to talk about this with. Obligatory, yes I have had many suicidal urges and one attempt in the past. I don't really want to die though, I just want things to be better, anything resembling the joy I felt when I was younger.

I've been struggling with depression for most of my life, wanting to not exist is one of my earliest memories.
I lost my job in 2019, then 2020 made it impossible to find another, found one last year and it was so awful I quit and now... I don't know what I'm doing.
My husband has been supporting me and I know it's wearing him down. Its been 3 fucking years of me struggling. We got in a fight last night that I started and he hasn't spoken to me all day. It's our 4 year wedding anniversary today.
My sister and I got into a fight a few weeks ago, and she told me no one in our family actually likes me, they all barely tolerate me, and that's why they hang out with her more. I know I haven't been the easiest to be around lately, so yeah. I fucking believe it. I called her a cunt and my mom wants me to apologize first but I'm not. My sister did not come to my birthday party because of it.
I've pushed a lot of people away. I don't have any close friends anymore. I know I'm obnoxious at times, judgemental often, late to everything and so so forgetful.
I was doing OK on just Adderall (late diagnosis), but I know I need to get back on to antidepressants. My psychiatrist switched offices and she's waiting to get approved by my insurance. I tried another psychiatrist and I was met with racism, hooray. My therapist is also no longer covered by my insurance, and my new therapist is... blah. I know I need meds but I don't know how to get them and I don't want to call another psychiatrist, it's exhausting going through the intake process with all my ~*trauma*~. My primary care physicians both left the practice/retired, my allergy doctor (I have a lot of health issues) also retired. 
My mom had me in high school, and I know abortion was an option for her. I wish she had taken it. Because leaving now would just cause too much pain in others, so I'm stuck.
I hate myself so much. I just want to be held and comforted, but I have no one. I've pushed away everyone, and I know they're sick of my constant fucking mental illness. I'm sick of it.
I cannot see a future. I just turned 30 and honestly I didn't think I'd make it this far. I'm in debt, no job, no close friends, I know my husband is thinking of leaving me. I would if I was him.

I've been depressed almost my entire life and I'm still young. My journey to adulthood (and currently is one) is when things started to go downhill. 

Ever since I was forced to go to the therapist and have myself diagnosed it tricked my mind that I'm a helpless person and people need to understand my health why I act certain ways. However I don't say a thing, I just hope that they 'know'.

It's toxic behaviour and each time I got into arguments with my family saying I'm crazy or should be unalive by any moment I'm destroying my future more. I suddenly want to quit my job, be free and run away. I'm too sensitive with raised voice or conflict, it made me give up very quick.

Yeah,i just created an account cause i really want to talk to somebody,even though i have a lot of friends that are always here for me i dont really speak to them abt this and because of that i somehow feel lonely. This past few weeks were normal but then it suddenly got worse, all started with me having bad grades which for some people wouldnt seem like something that would make you depressed but hey thats me and because of them bad grades i feel like a total disappointment. I was refused in nearly all the colleges ive sent my offers to and especially one which was abt architecture, and i really really wanted that one it mattered most to me and my parents. When i saw that “sorry,you werent selected” i couldnt beileive and i stared at it for a long period of time before i started crying. So now all whats on my mind is “you dont have a future” “youre a disappointment” “youre a failure” . Normally i was someone that you would consider as confident and egotistical and happy thats the thing that must people remember abt me because of my smile, but these past few days i was stuck in my bed crying and btw i felt releived everytime i balled my eyes out, i couldnt go out and even when i did i avoided every type of human interaction. Now i cant even look at my parents faces without crying i feel like a disappointment to them this the third i said it but disappointment is really the most accurate word that describes how im feeling, they have done everything for me and i have done nothing in return, btw same thing applies to my current relationship but thats not the main subject. Idk if this long or what but i just really wanted to share this because i dont know what to do i really dont im depressed have no energy cry on command disappoint everybody hurt everbody idk if i can really change that or am i destined to be like that all my life.

The reason wasn't even bcoz I wanted to have sex but bcoz at that's moment when sometimes she calls me or ask me to do i feel at that moment that yes she is mine, so just for that I did it even before sometimes it has been like this. But this she started crying after that and said that I raped her and even before I have done the same. I was completely devasted at what I did, I wanted to suicide bcoz I realized what i have done and I hated anyone who has raped someone.

Especially the one I wrote around a year and a half ago, in fall 2020, some things that I tried to 'warn' the future me about, yet I still didn't listen, because as if I wanted it all to get worse, just as everyone wants me to. And they try to convince you to change, because then it's going to get ""better"" - and no one fucking gets it when I say that's exactly what I don't want, because don't you see? If I change, I won't be myself anymore, I will be another brainwashed number in the system, without thinking twice about it. Because it's ""help"", and because this is what they do to people, make things get worse and worse until you can't stand it anymore, when you'd willingly remove all your thoughts and opinions just for a peace of mind, for it all to finally stop, because distractions are just distractions that eventually don't work anymore, and if I could I'd take pills and get drunk all the time, just to forget about reality, - but isn't that the same, just in a different way? Forgetting reality, becoming unaware, losing your identity, but then again, what even is real or not, is there any real universal truth or is everything just the matter of perception?

And I've already wrote to myself about this, many times, yet still haven't been able to reach a conclusion, because I'm too lost in my mind to ever achieve or understand anything. My thoughts are incomprehensible, I can't find a way to express myself, it all just makes me even more frustrated, because words are just words, and everyone who tells me they can understand me is a liar, because it's impossible to ever truly understand someone, isn't it? They can read, they can hear me, but no one else can *feel* it, and it's driving me insane. And nothing ever makes sense, and nothing helps, and there's nothing I can do about it, and all this helplessness I can do nothing about, yet I still keep complaining. I can't find a way to relieve the immense frustration I'm feeling, it's inescapable and all-consuming. I can't get rid of the deep loneliness and alienation I feel, it's not something that can be fixed by talking to people, because it's not just about the lack of social interaction, it's the self-awareness and knowing I'll never belong anywhere, out of place wherever I go.

No one gets it, how am I supposed to live in a world where there's no escape? This one quote, ""I will sooner die than betray my own thoughts"" really stuck with me, because I do think like this, essentially a lot of my 'philosophy' or whatever simplified into one sentence; and that's exactly what's bothering me the most right now. Is there anything in life that's actually worth living for? I can't even describe the way I'm feeling. Once again, I'd rather just forget everything, take something to make me unable to think. I'm tired of asking myself all these questions I know I'll never get an answer to, - it will only stop once I'm dead, but I can't even decide about that, because once again there's so many options to choose from, and I don't mean just methods; in a way I want to be forgotten like I've never existed in the first place, but then again it just doesn't feel right, because why do I have to go through all this just for it all to end like I've never even been here?

Venting is as useless as screaming at a wall, no one ever sees my posts anyway, and no one fucking **gets** it, sometimes I wonder if I'm the only one who's truly real.

First time poster here; I do not know if this is better posted here or on the BPD subreddit as I feel that my symptoms and feelings align with both. Apologies if I am wrong.

I feel like I am in another terrible rut and have been feeling this way since March slightly but it has gotten even worse along the way, especially with so many things on my plate involving school, family, relationships, even friendships. I've been trying to shrug it off but the stress of all these problems have been eating away at me to the point of it becoming debilitating and I would much rather just rot in bed all day. I eat probably just once a day to offset stomach aches and I lay in bed just thinking how bad I want this emotional and mental turmoil to end. I would never end up hurting myself but I keep having these involuntary thoughts of gruesome ways of being hurt, sometimes to the point of being cartoonish. They can't stop and it is all I fixate on until I start crying in fetal position in my bed. I feel so fucking pathetic that I let these problems consume me and that the bare minimum I can do is assignments that are due the day of and going to work (I used to pick up to 40-60 hour weeks but now I dread having to go in for 16 hour weeks).
I am so exhausted of being the oldest in an immigrant family because I am expected to help with everything such as legal paperwork, technological issues, etc. It has always been this way since I was a child and I would be lying if I said I didn't feel a little bit of resentment towards my younger siblings who have the freedom of not having to worry about the family. My sister can focus on college while I am expected to take care of so many things I never offered to help for.
This 'collective' mindset is honestly so toxic and it affects my academics. I get so upset because if I wasn't depressed when I was in high school then I would have graduated traditionally. Since then I have gotten my diploma through college and will finish with an AA after fall quarter but I can't help but feel jealous that my peers in the same high school class as me have acquired their Bachelor's this year. And I am stuck here knowing I can't live my life probably until after my parents pass.
I recently got broken up with and long story short it's evolved (maybe devolved is a better term) into a situationship where the dynamic isn't much different besides lacking the official partner label now. I feel that this is the problem that consumes me most because I feel a great sense of loss and support that was taken away prematurely due to outside factors out of our control. Currently we are debating if it is a good idea to try again but I feel as though I am the only one trying and I am torn between giving up or sticking it out. They are my favorite person and the stakes on my end are too high for me to give up.
On top of that I have had family problems due to an unresolved argument that has left me feeling betrayed by my own family. My family is already broken and dysfunctional to the point just even being at home makes me feel even more depressed.
I am so embarrassed of feeling this way that I have become reclusive and do not reach out to friends I used to hang out with regularly because in my mind, who wants to hang out with someone terribly depressed? They will just ruin the outing.
I have nothing going on for me and no one to lean on. I keep wishing that the stress will eat me alive in my sleep and so I do not have to wake up and suffer with my thoughts and feelings.

Communication - I have a stutter and can barely string a sentance together but I want a career in law

Intelligence - very average intelligence but all my friends and classmates who want to go into a law career are much smarter than I am

Social anxiety - stops me from doing anything. Won’t go to parties or go outside with my friends and family and I end up making excuses in order to not go . Terrified of talking to people on the phone.

Inferiority complex - I feel like everybody is superior to me and looks down on me as irrelevant 

Personality - haven’t got a personality whatsoever. Don’t make anyone laugh and can’t hold a conversation to save my life (big reason why no one has messaged me for over a month now and I’m always the one who has to starts the convo because people including my friends would rather talk to other people than myself)

General clumsiness - I’ve got no common sense whatsoever. I knock things over and smash things constantly. Other people don’t do this as often as I do

Relationships - only ever ended in rejection and my anxiety and depression has driven me to a point where I’m scared to talk to women because I’m boring and simply not interesting

Gaming - may seem irrelevant but I love doing it so much. I’m bad at every single game and when I play online I’m always bottom of the leaderboard and feel like a liability to my teammates. Gotten to the point where I’m messaging other gamers asking “how can I be as good as you”. Even games I’ve played since I was 6/7 (I’m 18 now) I’m still awful at

Alcohol -  the few times that I do go out I’m always the first to get drunk even though I drink the same or less than everybody else 


Self care - I’m 18 and I still can’t brush my hair because I’m awful at it and don’t want people to use that as another reason to look down on me 

Positives about me - I can read, write, ride a bike and swim

Lately things have been extra tough. My marriage is a mess, work is getting harder all the time, both my kids need help and I don’t have the energy to keep up anymore. It feels like I’m sinking.

She’s out of town this week with my son and my daughter is at her moms early this week so now I’m by myself. Not helpful right now. I spent the last 5 days with just my daughter, who’s struggling with issues in hopes that it would be enjoyable for both of us. We don’t get to spend much one on one time together. I tried so hard to make her happy and suck up my own issues to see if we could bond a little and make things better for both of us. All week she’s been asking to go back to her moms early.

When I’m alone, it’s like I leave reality behind and escape to wild places in my head, and it projects all over the room and transforms into my nirvana, my oblivion, my solitude. 

My body rots from the inside as my depression seeps across my body like a blanket. “Under the covers” that’s where I feel the most safe.. and lonely. It’s made to be escapism only I can’t escape.

I think I’ll kill myself if I have to take much more. Everyone surrounding me is toxic, miserable, and content. While I just want to be free, to truly escape.

Something else I’ve learned about myself is that I’m very lonely, more so than I thought before, And even though I often look down on people who yearn for a significant other to feel complete, I secretly yearn for one as well. I yearn to be loved and understood on an intimate level. I even imagine reading this aloud to someone as I’m writing it now. 

I also yearn for approval, very badly, I think. That’s why I’m always saying and doing stupid things to satisfy my thoughts of “what if they laugh?, what if they agree?, what if they like me after I say or do this?” Things that I don’t even agree with most of the time. But, I think I’d rather be judged for the things I say out loud that I don’t agree with than the things I do. Does that make sense?

I’ve learned that I have no respect for myself. None. That is why I degrade myself the way I do by saying stupid things in the first place. That is why I allow myself to be treated the way I’d, But why? Why am I like this? How could I be this amazing person in my head and be a completely different person on the outside? Who even am I? And why? Why? Why? Why am I so sad? And lost? And lonely? 

I need someone to explain it to me. I need someone to break it down, because no matter what I do, or where I go, how many lists I make, how many plans I make, or books I read, I can’t seem to find solace.

so around the beginning of april mid march i met someone, i for one don’t go out of my way to date, been played and other bs in the past so i decided to be alone and i was content with that, but i met this girl and she changed my whole perception on my ways of thinking. well during that time my big brother got sick and didn’t seem himself, so dealing with that, she was a very good distraction for me, well we went on our first date, it just so happened that a day before our first date, my big brother broke the news to me that he has cancer, instantly like i’m sure anyone who’s dealt with a loved one having it knows, you instantly think the worse. a lot of that time i felt like that. i wasn’t able to focus at work or do anything without thinking about my brother and his health. we weren’t the closest like i wish we were, life getting in the way, work, same with him. but growing up he was my hero. still is. anyways i went on my first date with her and i couldn’t focus, even she noticed and asked me, i felt comfortable enough with her that i could share that info with her and she of course was there for me. things went well, we started spending all my days off together and going places and she showed me a whole new outlook on relationships, i myself would miss work because of unfortunately my brothers health wasn’t doing good so i spent my days at the hospital with him. throughout that process my biological “mother” wasn’t treating me very good, nor his partner. she hasn’t been in my life since i was 6 and i’m 24 about to be 25 now, anyways i would be treated poorly at the hospital by her meanwhile he was intubated so he could get better. this girl was there for me throughout all of this. a gentle touch, a warm body to hold when i felt my lowest, she was there. my brother finally woke up and things seemed well, he got discharged started his chemo, we spent time together, made some memories, visited my grandfathers grave together, 2 weeks later his health turned again for the worst, this time it didn’t look good. june 3rd me and him talked for the last time in his room and he told me that he was dying, at this point i knew he was, but nobody told him yet. he felt it, before going into the room i was told he wasn’t going to survive, june 4th ironically my late grandpa’s birthday, my brother fought the good fight but he passed away. my hand was holding his on his final breaths and it brings me comfort knowing he felt my presence there. my mother didn’t grant his friends or his partner the ability to see him before he died, out of spite. i was torn up. i still am, but this girl was there for me. i saw her a few days after and at this point we have been together for a few months now, she literally cried to me the day i saw her after he passed and her reasoning for crying is because she felt bad about him going, that she felt like she knew him because of how much i would talk about him and how she wanted to meet him, she asked me to take her to his grave to visit him, all this stuff. i never felt so loved before. i didn’t know she cared like that. my brother before he passed when seeing me would ask about her and tell me all these cute places to take her because he loved romance and was happy for me. this girl treated me in ways that i’ve never had before. she brought me around her friends and included me on anything. for the first time in my life i felt like she was the one. i loved her. sorry if i’m unorganized but i’m going to touch on her previous relationship. she was with this guy who i won’t say any names but i’ll refer to him as simply “dickhead”. he was a piece of shit, the things he would do, would say to her, was awful. he was definitely an abuser, not physically as far as i know, but mentally. didn’t let her talk, never validated how she felt, for example, i bought her some flowers and she told me that nobody has ever did that, like my dudes flowers are $5 at heb like it’s not that hard. the dickhead never took anywhere. everywhere we went was her first time being there. i felt privileged that i showed her all that. i watched her grow into this beautiful person, well fast forward a month after my brother passed exactly. she seemed off. come to find out her ex hit her up and was claiming that he changed and missed her and all this shit. she told me and i told her, from personal experience people who can act like that for years, don’t change. they never do. i know dudes like that and they’ll always be stuck in their ways. well she was a firm believer that he really has changed. we had a talk, i gave her a choice, and she chose him. it was heartbreaking. truly tore me up because i loved her you know? how can someone who’s done so much for you, someone you claimed is the best guy to ever come into your life, that you want to be with forever, lose to some dickhead who doesn’t even know how to let you talk about your feelings ? or simply pay for your meal? it really fucked with my emotions on how i view my self worth. i feel worthless how can i lose to that? i’ve been through break ups before, it’s usually easy to forget someone, but i feel like this one hits me even harder than any because she was there for me when my brother was battling cancer and his death, someone i cried to, held, vented to, all these places i wanted to take her that he told me to, her crying to me about him, all of that, i think that’s why it’s so hard to shake how much i miss her and i’m not mad at her, i don’t hate her or anything, i truly hope for her sake he did change, because she doesn’t deserve to be put through the hell he did, i just don’t get how i could be thrown aside. i feel truly worthless, idk. i rambled a lot and i doubt anyone read to the end and i’m sorry, i just need to talk, i’ve been touching on the idea of speaking to a therapist. i just miss her, i miss my brother. these last few months have been hard. i don’t know what lays in store for me but if it’s feeling this bad, i don’t look forward to it.",True,False,False,depression,t5_2qqqf,886561,public,confidence,self,thinking about speaking to someone.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/wanv9i/thinking_about_speaking_to_someone/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,

My only pleasure if I do anything he Dislikes. Or worse off spank. We live in the middle of nowhere. I've dealt with this since I can remember. It hurts. I was then bullied throughout school. Because I'm weak. Scared. A nerd. Anytime I even got into a fight I can't controll it. I'd just start crying. So of course I was bullied my whole time in school. Even the people I thought was my friends lying to me. Stealing. Using. Bullying. That's my childhood.

I got through that and now im a useless guy. My only joy my gaming computer. No friends to play with. Nobody to entrust or talk to. My parents and step mom talk badly behind my back. I can't get a job for shit because I wasn't pushed to get any useful skills. I don't know how. Never taught how to try to get a job.

Friends? I got one. He only talks with me when It benefits him or if it's to have one more guy to game with. Girlfriend? She's always busy? All she does is babysit. At her own home.

Have an hour of lucidity so I thought I should write you for some council.

Like many of you I suffer from manic depression, and over the past ten years or so, a little more than that I guess, I've dealt with this to some very narrow definition of success--harmlessly, let's say, or, neutrally to others than myself and maybe my parents on occasion--by intentionally keeping myself out of close relationships, because I've never really had long-term control over my episodes and haven't wanted to put that on anyone but me (the unpredictable and overlong nonlinear breakdown, the transformations unbidden and never towards making me any kinder, the suicidality, etc.) especially without the promise of improvement, because it hasn't really, so what can I do. Nevertheless, I *was* doing pretty well over the last two years (sad but not self-destructive) and ventured to make a close friend, and, against obvious reasons to the contrary, I did! Blessedly, blessedly, blessedly I did not, no; I was given a friend, granted it, couldn't be earned. It has been life-saving, truly.

===========================


But the last two weeks, after a year of companionship, I've really broken down, instigated by what? I can't say. Sadly either you can't know or your mental state makes it immediately irretrievable, you can't imagine ever wanting this, you don't possess it like self-knowledge without great sacrifice, so how can you think now of reasons. Anyway, I guess being fully unmoored and immobilized myself, I have latched on to the happenings of my friend's life as a platform for expressing some deeply shameful, harmful, (and it goes without saying) agonizingly atypical (as far as she know me), tendencies. And it's destroying me, what I've had to say (we're long-distance, online.) I want to be gentle and kind and meek and be able to look both ways before I think only good and recognizably generous thoughts, pure at heart, but I'm just all over the place, no reserve at all, whatever-- it's all been said before what it's like, you know: not good.

===========================

The crux is that I don't really know what to do with a person here in the midst of this, I only know how to do alone, with no one there to harm or be ashamed of me, or fear about these things in front of, but I'm afraid if I go I won't come back or won't be invited back perhaps, and it goes too without saying that their losing a friend is no easy burden, worse arguably. How have you all managed to be so sick and kept others so close?

It was the first time anyone was seeing me in this emotional/depressed state. After that he asked me what was going on and i couldnt speek, i was just trying to seek for air. He sat there and was trying to get me chilled. I was barelly understandable but i was saying like what is live and why should i live something like that. He told me that live is about eating, having a women by your side, having children, having a good and fun job, and living live . This answer is just to simple i feel like is this really live?. this was about 2 Months ago and i said fck it lets go for 10 straight days with my friends to vacation and maybe this will help me but i still get these i call them attacks.

Also; english is my second language, so please forgive any typos or grammatical errors.

First of I want to say that this is no ""rebellious teenager phase"". My loss of love for my father has been a slow and steady process. I would never dissrespect or be intentionaly mean to my father. I respect him and I obey his very strict and depressing laws, as I still live in his house, tho I wish I didn't. Ever since I was a child I have never really ""liked"" my father, because of our differences. But he was still my father, and he played with me, which is pretty much any 6-year-olds standard for love. But as I grew older, and started to get individual interests, I started to stop loving my father. This is why:

My hobbies: Video games, Movies, Tv-shows, Comics, Space, History, Music etc.

Pretty common hobbies for a 15-year-old. This is what makes me happy, and they are pretty important to me. 

My father's house laws: No violent video games (minecraft is considerd a violent video game (no, this is not a joke(yes he knows what you do in it))) No non-documentary movies, no Tv-shows, no comics, he's critical of science as a whole because of religious values and he thinks rock music is satanic, so non of that.

I suffer from social anxiety, and I have been diagnosed with severe depression from a psychiatrist, and I have cut my arm, (he knows this) and my father doesn't let me take anti-depressents. So when you spend every other week doing nothing that makes u happy, it get's pretty bad.

Now my dad does want me to recover from my mental illnesses, but not enough to loosen his restrictions. So he does nothing about it, except being extra ""nice"" to me, which I guess I like, but being nice to your own son is kinda an obvious thing you should do lol.

Like i mentioned: my dad is very religious, he's a christian, and I'm not, he knows that, and respects that, and I respect his religion. But I'm still not allowed to celebrate halloween because it's satanic, and I'm constantly told how basic things are satanic, like hollywood movies, and rock music.

Now all I've asked him for is to maybe watch a non-violent movie, with headphones, on my phone. But no. Not in his house.

How does he expect me to still love him? Yet even like him? I wan't to spend more time at my mom's house, who instead of banning my interests, support them, but whenever I bring it up, he acts sad, dissapointed and suprised. 

Am I actually in the wrong? I don't want to make my dad sad, but I don't know what to do.

I can’t help but think this world isn’t meant for me. I can’t do anything right and it’s extremely hard for me to understand literally anything. I do believe I’m really behind mentally from everyone my age which causes 
me to keep putting on an “act”. I pretend I’m in the same headspace when I’m just not. I’ve been called  retarded, stupid, slow, dumb, etc. all because I don’t understand or I do things slightly different. Maybe they think me not understanding means I wasn’t listening? I don’t know but I know they only said that to insult me which only further adds to my anxiety and staying away from people. 

There are times I step from my performance to ask what other people might think are dumb questions. They act like I’m being “dumb” on purpose when I’m not dumb I just need more of an understanding. And I wish everyone would understand that. I act because I’ve received responses that just make me want to hide from everyone for the rest of my life. I mimic and act. That’s all I do. I’ve never been my own person because I don’t know how to. Everyone treats me like weird when I’m myself so I stop being myself a long long time ago but sometimes a little bit of me slips out. I zone in really hard on my “talents” to distract people from me if that makes sense. So I put all of my focus into a pipe dream.

I think what sucks the most is I’ve been doing this for so long that everyone thinks I’m putting on act when I’m myself. I’ve been trying to be like everyone else but I just can’t anymore. I can’t keep up with everyone, every time I take a step forward it’s like the world takes 2 extra steps so no matter what I’m still behind. 

If I don’t understand a joke I fake laugh because if I ask I’ve ruined  it for everyone or frustrated someone enough to not even explain it. 

I barely speak because I stutter and slur my words a lot. This causes me to also pause a lot of the time and no one wants to wait for me to get the words out so I just shut myself up.

I walk kind of funny which causes me to sway if stand in one place for too long. I’m either, stressing myself out making sure I stand “right” or I just don’t go out. 

My social anxiety is so bad that I  freak out in public. A few times  but not recently since I am an adult and someone would think something is severely wrong with me. I just get really jittery sweaty and frustrated. This also causes me to sway. ALOT.

I’m either super quiet or super loud. I have no volume control what so ever which I know first hand annoys people. I’m legitimately trying I just can’t find the right volume my voice box won’t fucking let me.

People point out my “abnormalities” so I have no choice but to be aware of em. I’m so frustrated with myself and the world. I’m mad at me for not having a good brain and I’m mad at the world for not understanding the cards I were dealt. Im trying but it’s not enough. 

I can’t afford help because I don’t make nearly enough to support that, my life, and anybody that’s in it. I can’t find anything better because of my inability to keep a job. I’ve tried fast food but I move way too slow for that. I made mistake after mistake because my mind gets so foggy that I can’t think straight which is a huge hindrance. I’ve been finding work from home jobs since those fiasco’s and Ive even had issues with those but I have to suck it up and do something. I now have a shitty job annoying people to take surveys for 12an hr and do Instacart on the side just because it’s extra money and it gets me out the house for a few hours by myself without feeling like I’m rushing my wife or whoever I’m with. 

I feel out of place no matter where I go or what I do. It’s now getting worse to the point I feel awkward around my family because I spend so much time away. I’m also married so the act that I put on is slowly breaking down because it’s extremely stressful keeping it up 24/7. I can only pretend a few minutes before my battery runs completely dead and after that I don’t want human contact whatsoever. 

It’s just an endless cycle of depression and anxiety. No matter how many prescriptions I take. This just really makes me hate myself because I want to feel better and I want to be better but as an adult this shit really sucks. I was able to blend in when i was a kid but now it just feels like people think I’m this way for fun. I’ve been obsessing over the idea of suicide for the past decade but now I have a full proof plan that I could set in motion at anytime but I fear for the aftermath. What if it doesn’t work? Would I be even more alone afterwards? Will the few people in my life actually even bother to stick around? I already ask myself those questions daily so this is just another cycle of what ifs and questions that I don’t want to live with because it makes me anxious. If I could find the right time I would end it in an instant but those unanswered questions are the only thing holding me back. I just need a driving force, something that’s so painful that I’m able to take that step. I pray that something takes me out in my sleep most nights.

Anyway, I know my depression is slightly disabling where I sometimes can't get my daily activities done, but its not bad to the point where I'm in a major depressive episode like I've had in the past.  Basically, I can go through life, do things I enjoy,  but overall just have this kind of blah outlook on life. I don't want to get on meds because for me, the risk vs benefits don't seem to balance out (sure I can be happy, but at the cost of possibly gaining weight, brain fog, suicidal thoughts, low sex drive, etc). But I want to be able to be open about it. I don't want to live just pretending to be happy, or being ""just fine"" to everyone.  At the same time, I don't want it to be my only personality traits.  I also have good days and bad days so not every day is going to be hard.

I'm worried with today's society, people won't care. they will just brush it off like ""go get a therapist"" (I haven't had the best experiences with the several therapists I've gone to).  This might also just be a response to the fact my ex only saw my depression as a burden to him, like he had to take care of me, when really I just wanted him to understand me and know I have days where I might struggle to function. I already feel self conscious about being depressed that I don't want to add extra burden onto others.  But at the same time  I know that there are people that could connect to my story and want to know me as a person who happens to have depression. 

This post feels kind of rabble-y but basically I'm just wondering how to manage being open about what I struggle with without making others feel like they need to put extra care into me. Sure that's kind of on them to not sacrifice themselves at the cost of caring for me bc that's not what I want, but I just want people to know what's going on with me.

I don’t want to get a counselor because other people have bigger problems, and I don’t want to waste their time or my parents' money. Like I said though I can’t have any mental health issues because everything besides my relationships is perfect. My dad makes a lot of money, we have a nice house, and I always have something to do. I have my own smartphone, my own clothes, my own room and even my own computer. Everything's good in my life so I have no right to feel unhappy. I need to live up to the expectations my parents have but I can’t even keep my grades up. I’m just a failure and that’s all I’ll ever be.

So my psychiatrist recommended I do a partial hospitalization program due depression, anxiety, suicidal 
Ideation. I have done this program before a few times, with the last time being around February. During that time in February, I had a suicide attempt, had to go inpatient for a few days, and they “kicked” me out due to the attempt. When my psychiatrist suggested this, I told my him I was worried that they actually wouldn’t want me to try again. He said he would look into it. 

Well I was right because I got a call from the psych office and they said the program thought I would be more appropriate to do a DBT group one time per week. I told them I can’t really just do a group one time per week due to work. With the PHP, I could be on short term disability and have no worries. They called and said fine to come do the PHP, but I’m so worried. I don’t want to be anywhere I’m not wanted.

I'm 25(f) and have been clinically depressed since I was in high school. I went a very long time fighting it without help, but then a suicide attempt when I was 18 caused me to get medicated and start being seen by a psych.

Things were actually pretty good for a while, but then my meds stopped working, my psych fired me as a client, and COVID hit causing me to lose my health insurance. 

I have been untreated for my clinical depression for three years now. Honestly, for a while it was semi-tolerable. I'm what I like to call ""functionally depressed"". I still work, I still keep my apartment clean, I still take my cat to the vet on time, I still take care of my car maintence. My life seems fairly put together.

However, my physical health is a mess and my mental health has been steadily declining more and more. I desperately need mental health treatment. I know getting medicated again and seeing a therapist will be a first step in turning my life around, and I want to do it very badly. The issue? I don't have full-time work, which means I don't have benefits, which means I can't afford healthcare. Since graduating college in 2020, I have applied to 4000+ jobs. This includes jobs at the college I graduated from, which I worked at through the entirety of my schooling. 

I took a really terrible hit to my mental health this week. I applied for a job I really wanted, one I thought I would enjoy and that would give me the ability to start turning my life around. I didn't get it. The daughter of a person working in the department got it. 

I just don't know what to do. Not getting that job, when I had been so hopeful that I would, so I could finally get treatment and stop being a failure, sent me spiraling. My passive suicidal ideation, which I've had for 2.5 years now, has turned into active suicidal ideation. I had to get up last night and flush my big bottle of ibuprofen down the toilet because I was getting closer and close to just swallowing a bunch of pills and hoping it would kill me.

I feel hopeless, honestly. I can't escape the hole I'm in, no matter how hard I try. I feel pathetic, worthless, unloved. I hate myself so fucking much. 

I honestly want to die. There's just no point in anything anymore. Why should I even try anymore if three years of struggling has resulted in nothing but more pain and disappointment?

Long story short: 
I became depressed at 14-15, messed up high school, and spent most of my twenties in a depression haze without any goals or interests; dead-end job. At 26 I realised I'd never beat this shit on my own, got an appointment to an amazing private clinic - there I found out I also have GAD (generalized anxiety disorder), found a med combo and dosage that worked, and spent the following years recovering, and most importantly, I was finally capable to study all the courses I needed (via municipality adult education). 


Life is actually amazing, for once. The dead-end job pays pretty well for what it is, and has made me able to buy an apartment and everything in it. Quite a lot of savings at this point. The university is basically walking distance from where I live. I'm in Sweden, so the tuition is ""free"" i.e. tax funded. The university loans have basically no interest rate here either and we have many decades to pay it back. Excellent circumstances IMO.

We've been in a relationship for 2 years, he always had problems with his self-esteem and his perfectionism, but lately it's so much worse to the point where I can hardly stand it.
If he loses in a game, makes a mistake or something goes wrong, he starts crying and screaming or he gets so angry that he hits objects and sometimes himself. Even if it's something insignificant, he cries and gets so desperate that I don't know what to do.

He has become so stubborn that I cannot help him in any way.
He has already gone to therapy a few times and has not been diagnosed with anything, he doesn't want to go back because he says it's useless and stupid. 
When he's not mad, he tells me I'd be better off with someone else but also that I am the only good thing that he has in his life.

This kinda hit me hard. So this morning, when I had made a morning coffee, I put the bedding onto wash, threw the window open and sprayed lots of Febreze about the place. Hoping that by washing/making the bed and having the window open, it'll freshen the room up.

Once I've finished work and had dinner, i'm definitely getting myself in the shower. It actually amazes me how the need to shower, something I used to do 2 times a day before, is just something I / we can forget to even do.

I was at the peak happiness when I found him, traveling solo and loving myself after going through a lot. 

We split mostly due to our communication abilities, he initiated the break up and I can tell he cares about me, but he does not love me in that sense anymore. 

Ever since then, I went back to feeling “dead” inside. I drink everyday (I’ve noticed I’ve been doing that for more than a year now just telling myself it’s just a glass and then end up finish a whole bottle of wine)

I went back to smoking cigarettes a lot as an escape system, I struggle to eat and even get out of bed. It’s like looking through a window and realizing everyone around me is strong and handles things in a better way than I do and I don’t have the strength to do it and just give in to my depression. 

He also struggles with depression and today we talked for the first time after two weeks post break up I told him I’m tired of living. We chatted about our relationship and I broke down. We spent a long time chatting about how he wants to help me find a support system and tomorrow we are going to look for a professional to help me. I already take medication but I feel like it has stopped having an effect on me as I’m back to where I was. 

He’s the only one in my life right now who actually took the time to listen to me, all my friends are busy and I’ve given up on relying on them for help. Also I don’t want to worry my parents so I pretend everything is fine (I live overseas and that alone takes a toll sometimes where I just can’t handle it sometimes) 

He is the love of my life and I am sure that I’ll never find someone like him, but I know he cares about me just doesn’t like
me romantically anymore. And it affected me so deeply that I don’t feel anything anymore. 

I feel like every time I get a shot at happiness, life takes it away from me. I’m just exhausted and existing and struggling even to go to make my bed let alone go to work. 

I had a few months of a glimpse into happiness and that was it. When he was gone, so was the happiness. Not because I need him, but because he showed me love in a way no one ever did. Because for once in years I felt alive. 

The only reason I’m not “gone” is because of my parents and my cat who needs me, and I need him to, but apart from that I’m tired of going to stage zero and feeling like all the effort of trying to push myself up is gone. 

I have another solo trip booked in for two months but I’m not even looking forward to it as I know it might just be another escape route.

I don’t trust antidepressants because of an incident when I was in college. Awful, ignorant school administration people and awful, ignorant hospital people gave me a mandated cocktail of drugs (as in, the school said they’d kick me out if I didn’t take them) that, when I got out of that cesspool of awfulness and ignorance (think of a US state that’s often the butt of jokes like that) and back into a decent (at the time) place, my regular doctor told me that it was extremely unsafe and even illegal to prescribe that amount, and to combine those drugs. 

I think I’ve solved my depression by basically just quitting society. 

I don’t live in the woods or anything. I have a job (that rarely requires me to interact with people). I ride the subway and I don’t set it on fire or start fights. I pay taxes. I’m not breaking any laws.

By quitting society, I mean… I don’t try to fit in anywhere. I don’t listen to things about what your life “should” be like. I don’t try to restrain my lifestyle into something I can expect people to understand. 

I don’t believe in formal schooling — I finished college online because I needed a degree to get a visa, but I don’t think it was beneficial. I never want to get married. I don’t want to stay in one country for more than ten or twenty years, and I don’t believe in nation-states (people like to quote “imagine there’s no countries” but they very rarely actually imagine it. Or when they do, they think it would make everyone selfish, but I think that a borderless world would make everyone love each other as individuals instead of being racist.) 

I’ve looked at certain things and realized that sometimes the beliefs that everyone takes for granted are actually the opposite of what would be productive. 

I don’t try to explain or justify myself to people. I’ve lived in 5 countries on 3 continents and I’m just comfortable with the fact that I’m excluded from everything, everywhere. Being included isn’t worth it. Wanting to be included is what makes you depressed. 

People have these mental blocks, like… if they look at something and try to understand it, and the evidence points to a conclusion, but that conclusion is something that most people would think was weird, then the person who came to that conclusion becomes afraid. They sink into denial, because they’re afraid of being seen as weird.

They also just wouldn’t know what to do with the knowledge that all their friends and family are wrong. I could give the example of a dissenter from religion living in almost any society 500 years ago, and you might laugh and think your society doesn’t have any such superstitions enshrined as objective fact nowadays. But they do.

I don’t know. I also just wasn’t “raised” to fit in. My parent thought it was fine for me to sit by myself and read books and not play with the other kids, because that’s what they did at that age. My parent always did things other people thought were weird, and didn’t care that they thought that. 

I am lonely, and I do want friends. I do have physical distress from loneliness. But it’s not worth it to give up the things I’d have to give up, to torture and dismember myself in order to corrupt myself into something others can understand.

I think it’s impossible that I’m the only one who feels the way I feel — I think it’s impossible for anyone to ever be the only one who thinks something, because there are just too many people out there — and I’m writing novels that reflect my view of life, in order to attract people I might have something in common with. 


But… my point is that I think society is the problem. People don’t realize how small society is. Modern societies, even the most open of them, aren’t that different from those superstitious, witch-burning people 500 years ago. I mean, why does everyone still dress the same? You might say “they don’t”, but then why is it still possible to attribute times and places to styles of clothing? Why can I look at someone — random photos online — and, in most cases, guess what country, or at least what continent, they’re from by how they dress? Same with graphic design styles. Regional speech patterns.

What I mean by “I quit society” is also that I don’t fit into any one group based on those things. My accent or fashion sense can’t be labeled as any one place, nor can my drawing style. I don’t think it would be worth it to restrain these things to fit in, and I don’t have any inclination to do so.

I think that people who do have the inclination to fit in are all depressed, even if they look happy. They just either drink, or do drugs, or watch sports, or get religious, or read escapist novels, or get into true crime stuff online… they’re just trying to distract themselves from their doubts. Trying to cut off those doubts, convince themselves that society is right. To shame those thoughts out of themselves.

Which is why they’re so cruel to those of us who listen to the doubts, who opt out of things that don’t feel right. 

But distraction and suppression aren’t the answer… exploring and embracing the doubts, and finding another way… that’s necessary. 

Anyway, the writer and subject of the book I’m listening to both talk about trying to fit in at school and work, trying to make friends with whoever life randomly sticks them next to, going to bars with people, and things like that, and like… I’m not saying medication never helped anyone, I’m not saying there aren’t people who’d need it, but like… I just want to ask, have you tried just quitting?

Just… stop scheduling your life around who’s doing what at the bar, stop being afraid of missing out on things that never made you happy in the first place (“but everyone says this will make me happy, everyone says this is how to have a life, today might be the day it works for me”… remember that old cliche about it being the definition of insanity to try the same thing and expect a different result?). Meditate. Read a new genre of books, listen to a new genre of music. Think of a thing you’ve heard of that’s vaguely interesting — playing an instrument? Ancient Egypt? Facts about birds? — and google it, or search on youtube. Read/listen to philosophy, and not just ones you agree with already.

Create yourself away from your “community”, because they don’t actually care about you.

One of those days where I just didn't wake up right. One of those days I just want to give up and I just keep imagining why I just can't let go of everything.

&amp;#x200B;

I have being a jaybird people with a heavy need for care for more than 10 years and in this time even though some things have changed, I am still not able to do basic things of my daily life because I'm not able to afford caretakers. I depend on the help of a part-time caretaker and my ex-wife who is moving out of the house. I am quadriplegic, so, doing things alone is not an option.

&amp;#x200B;

It's complicated to depend on someone that is trying to move on with her life mostly because my whole situation became a burden between us. It's not her fault, I understand that accumulating the roles of wife, mother(4 our son), caretaker, housekeeper, and still trying to find time to work took a heavy toll on her and she was really strong trying to keep everything together during our romantic relationship. I am just glad we ended things and could keep a friendly relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

Even though things are like this, it's not a sustainable situation to be living together with my ex-wife and son. To be able to move on we have to be able to be in separate houses. The only thing I have to complain about her is her attitude. There are a lot of subjects that I'm just not able to talk to her. I can't find the words, the way are the moment. She was raised by a narcissist mom and I understand that she has defense mechanisms because of that, but I am just tired to be on the receiving end of the attacks of a person used to be attacked all the time. I understand but I am so tired...

&amp;#x200B;

I am still trying to find a work just so I can be able to make things bearable. I am an ESL teacher and I can give glasses online, but my life is it is right now does not allow me to organize much my routine so I can advertise and manage commitments death needs to work on a schedule. I have tried to reach for help but I couldn't make anyone listen. I am in a conundrum where are you I need money to pay caretakers to be able to have a basic routine in my life again but I can't do it without help or without finding work and I can't do these things because of a lack of routine... Am I making sense to you?

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't know what to do anymore and to be completely honest, I would have done something to check out early quite some time ago but I don't even have the physical condition to do this to myself alone.

&amp;#x200B;

 I am trying day after day to keep going, to find ways. My son is my biggest joy in life and I wouldn't want to miss everything he is going to do yet, but I also don't want to feel like a burden to him, I don't want to see him sad because I just can't go to my wheelchair to spend time with him that way he wants. I am so tired of suffering alone in silence and there's so much more to say but I don't even know where to start. These thoughts we're never translated to words before. Every chance I had I would just cry, but nowadays it feels like I don't have the strength not even to cry anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

 I am really sorry to bother anyone who read it, I'm just feeling like if I could, I would have exploded already. I never imagined feeling anything like this in my life. I can now understand the meaning of the word ""overwhelming"".

He would always ask for advice and help if he needed it. We went through all the advice about safe sex and drugs and stuff like that. He has been no trouble and we remain very close still. Don't get me wrong ,he is no angel and we do have the odd row but we always brush it off afterwards and are good friends again in no time.

My issue now is that he has a girlfriend for the past 6 months and I have met her a few times and she is really nice. They suit each other very well but I have noticed that I am starting to get a little jealous that he spends all his time with her. I feel like he has forgotten all about me and it's hard enough to get time to talk to him now. I feel like I am thrown on the scrapheap after all these years. I know it's normal for him to want to be with a pretty girl and I know they are having sex and it's a whole new experience to him and I get that. 

I don't actually mind that he has a girlfriend and we talked about safe sex and boundaries and things like that. It's just that I feel a little left behind seeing as we are so close. I know he loves me and cares for me but I probably just miss him being around me all the time.

My parents keep giving me these life lessons about how I have no friends and I need to open myself up and let people in but refuse to acknowledge that I used to have a lot friends and they all turned on me, bullied me, dragged my mental health to its lowest point, then blamed me and my lack of texting ( which they didn't text either) for our broken friendships and proceeded to talk shit about me to people who didn't even know me.
People assume I'm okay because academically I'm a good student, not the best but I would say maybe I'm in the top 25%, however academia comes easy to me, I just finished my degree in which I barely studied and left all the work for the last minute. Now I am about to start a masters degree that could very well change my academic and financial life for the better. However, emotionally I'm still back in 8th grade when everyone turned on me, I'm not in a relationship and honestly don't feel the need to be in one, my emotional maturity is hasn't changed since then and I feel so behind.
So when I see people who were and are a part of life thriving and having many friend and exciting social lives I can't help but to help but to hate them a little bit cause they moved on after the shit they did to me and I'm still stuck with no one to help me out.

I've felt this way before although I've never felt I have Anxiety, but the situation can be relatable.

As a child thing we're hard but my parents made it work.
I wasn't ever scared of dark places like I intemperate you mean it, so I can't comment there, sorry.

Through middle school I craved attention while easily excelling at classes. (""Yeah those kids got a D but look at the fun they had)

This led me to my high school friend group after years and a few unrelated incidents.

I could rant for hours of how 16-21 impacted me and much of this stemmed from that i wanted connection.

So where did that leave me?

Well.

When I was 20 I only hung out with my friends I was comfortable with to party. Did they like me? Was I normal? Was this benefiting me? I surely thought yes at the time. I only knew girls that I thought I could hook up with. I knew it was wrong, but I had already decided kids weren't for me and I'd be a garbage father anyway. Don't worry every girl I was with knew the situation and how I felt however few that was.

Then I grew older continuing this trend.

Scared of commitment, growing and becoming a man, and hid myself away.

For years.

At 24 or 25 I met a girl that both was the Light of my eyes and currently the Harbinger of my downfall.

I'll skip all details here but turns out I was right. I'm a bad father (my best efforts were insufficient) and an abysmal partner (ask her if you want to know more I don't care)

But looking back even as I just stopped (stopped haha id respond to her ANYDAY like a fool) talking to her not even a week ago after almost 5 years (and finding out a fact that makes me feel better but literally means nothing and actually kind of makes it worse) im still the same scared, weak and now beaten, old, and broken kid I was when I was 12.",True,False,False,depression,t5_2qqqf,886425,public,confidence,self,I was going to post this as a response to someone on here but I typed it and realized I'm only talking about myself.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/wa4e61/i_was_going_to_post_this_as_a_response_to_someone/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,

I'm 20. All my life I was just unnacepted by everyone. And I'm not your typical emo guy, or anything like that. No offence to anyone, I respect everyone's opinion and lifestyle.

I just always wanted to be normal, to be like everyone. And I'm surely intelligent enough to see that nobody really loves me. I had a ""best-friend"" 2 times and it ended terribly with first and horribly with second. Both times I was always the one who called first and that kind of story, you all probably know how it goes. I acted bad then, desperately trying to keep that friendship (with last one), that maybe screwed my other friendships. 

I have no problem having no best friend, but I'm now sure I'm not really fully accepted and loved by anyone. In every friend meeting I just can be there or I'm not, to my friends it doesn't make any difference really (I'm usually not called but sometimes I am). Like I can be there or I could not, it doesn't matter. That's really contradictory to the fact my friend group is really big, like more than 15 guys, we are like one big group but like divided in few more. And guess what, I'm not in any of these smaller groups. And I'm not always alone, I sometimes play football, games with my friends, but yesterday night I really confirmed I'm really unimportant part of any of these groups or to anyone of these people, and it's not in my mind, it was almost openly said by someone.

Now about me, I'm 20yo, attending one of the best colleges in my country, currently struggling a bit but surely I can fix it, I also earned some money so if I fail a year I can easily pay for another one. I'm also sure I have ADHD. Don't start with ""you are lazy"". If you are gonna reply, accept it. Me and my parents noticed that since I was a kid. Also maybe depression and anxiety is what came with it last year.  To study now and not to shake all day I have to self medicate (benzos) and they really help me get numb and study for few hours. I'm already addicted but not using high doses so I don't get bad withdrawals (I know I will have them, or I won't if I continue to be on them for life) I don't have access to any other drugs but not really much interested and I don't see how they would help.

And for ADHD I spent hours and hours and months and I'm absolutely sure it's right I have it. And there's no doctor or treatment in my coutnry for it. Even considered finding medication ilegally (or amphetamines to help me study, because studying for me is mental torture, but it wouldn't be that bad if I wasn't this depressed, I won't even start about anxiety that goes with it). I'm sort of asexual, and I can't understand people like me (I don't even knows if it is in LGBT) that are promoting it and putting it everywhere on their insta/social networks, like I'm seriously very ashamed of it.  

My family doesn't know this, they hope I will find a girlfriend one day and I'll be fine. also doesn't know for my self-medication (they would kill me) and I talked to my mother about depression, and she's open minded about it, she realised she had some sort of it too and went to psych and got her therapy 2 days ago (escitalopram I think)

I was maybe rude in this post, but I'm nothing like this in real life, I'm your typical very kind guy to everyone, maybe I should try to be a piece of shit to get the respect I need. But really, I honestly dont't see what would get me out of this crap. Can't say I'm suicidal because I fear it, but if have an instant die button there are times I would surely click it. Is there anything to help me? I'm ready to start cutting all my friends and start finding new one, would that combined with some antideppresants at least get me happier life?

That life is hard so they took the easy way out. At least that's what I told myself. Deep down I thought dying was the scariest thing ever. 

That was back when I was a kid. When life was simpler, brighter, easier. When I knew everyone in my little world and everything was so simple. Back when I cared enough to lay awake at night, terrified of death. 

When I was really young, I was excited to wake up. There were a million things I wanted to do. Then when highschool rolled around, I was more scared at night than anything. Now I kind of wish I could drift away into a deep sleep that'll last forever. That I could be sent into a coma and have an excuse not to wake up. Death doesn't keep me up at night cause it doesn't sound so bad anymore. 

I'm an anxious wreck on the inside, everything scares me  I'm scared to leave my house when I have free time, I'm scared to go to school, I'm scared to do anything. I feel like im having a battle with myself and both sides are losing. At least I'm good at hiding it. Life really has been constant suffering for a long time now. And it's been hitting really hard since high school. 

I've been depressed from all the anxiety for years and my greatest wish has been to disappear to a new world for a very long time. I'm always looking for an excuse to die like, maybe i can work at a really dangerous job, sign up for the army, or maybe i do something heroic but way too dangerous. 

But I can't physically end myself for several reasons, although i have thought about it and how to do it a lot. Firstly I'm too scared to do it because of my anxiety. Second, it would hurt my family so much. And third, I made a promise to myself when I was younger that I would stay strong and never do something like that.

I don't want others to worry and I want to be alone, but I want to tell people at the same time. I guess for advice or some sort of person to person understanding. All I know is that I'm stuck in this unfair, cruel world full of suffering and I have no idea what to do. 

I spend my free time trying to distract myself from reality by watching videos or playing games, but nothing is fun anymore. Socializing is agonizing because I need to fake laugh, fake reactions, and fake being happy, which is getting really difficult.

I made another post about my loneliness. Not having anyone to talk to has made me genuinely mentally sick. Yet most of the comments were rude, insulting or giving me unhelpful criticism.

I'm lucky with having a good family, being somewhat smart enough to have stable income &amp; bought a home 2 years ago, so not everything is completely wrong with me... but I struggle so so much, regardless of what is going right.   


I'm stuck at a job that I hate. I can't concentrate whatsoever and can't get shit done... I just to the bare minimum so shit keeps working out. Everytime I find somewting that I might enjoy even a little, it doesn't work out in the end and I'm so so so down cause I feel like the biggest looser ever. I can't afford to just switch to a job I might like better for 2 reasons. I bought a fucking home and have to pay the bills. I'm super scared to change to another workplace cause it might turn out even worse than what I have right now so that wouldn't work out well with my depression.  


1 year ago I met my boyfriend. He's the most caring, loving and perfect person I could've ever imagined. I had 2 relationships prior this one, both ended slowly &amp; painfully because I decided I have to protect my partner from going down with me. I tols them exactly how I felt and that I can't keep dating them because at some point, their life's gonna go up in flames if they stay with me. I really hoped what happened in the past wouldn't happen again but it's starting again.  


I'm sad all day every day but keep a poker face towards everyone except my boyfriend. All sadness &amp; anger towards myself is thrown at him daily and I can't stop. I feel this constant urge to tell someone I feel so miserable. I treid talking about it to my family but that never worked well, I don't have friends so he is the only one I can really talk to. I've put on about 12kg over the last 12 months and can't look at myself anymore. That leads to no intimacy at all &amp; me not wanting to attend socail events at all. There's a party my boyfriend's friends invited us to. We didn't see them for over a year so they don't know I gained so much weight... I canceled and broke my boyfriend's heart bcause I don't want them to see me like this... I could already hear them talking things behind my back like ""woooow she gained some weight huh?"" I have THE WORST relationship with food and sports so ""just lossing some weight"" is like mission mars to me.  


I just feel so miserable and think of ending this life daily but know exactly I could never kill myself. I couldn't do it to my family. So now I'm stuck in this complete mess and have no way out whatsoever. I'm barely alive and questioning people's urge to survive and live this life on a daily.

To preface, I know the concept of ghosting is wrong. But the truth is I’ve never felt guilty about it because the reason I ghost guys I like is because I’m fully convinced they have no interest in me. The truth is I still feel like the victim every time. I guess if anything that’s where my guilt comes from.

It has happened so many times. I never learn. The worst of it was with someone I was genuinely in love with who convinced me for a moment that he was really in love with me too, but my mind fought back until I figured out a way to call BS. Ghosted him and went into a dark place of regret and self-hatred for almost two years. I swore that was going to be my breaking point, that I would learn from that and never do it again.

I’ve done it again. This was nothing serious, but he was the first guy I really actually liked since the guy I loved. We went out a few times and slept together, after which I convinced myself he had gotten what he needed and was going to disappear and hurt me in the end. He did nothing to make me think that, I just overthink and over analyze every single word and tone and tiny little thing.

I’ve never been in a relationship, I’ve never truly experienced love, I’ve never even had a proper fling, and it’s completely my fault for shutting everyone out. I know the obvious answer is to go to therapy, I know the obvious problem is me. I know I’m in the wrong over and over again and please believe me when I say I’m hard on myself for it. I push people away because I can’t possibly imagine they’d be interested in me, and then I end up hating myself even more on top of missing them when I don’t have the right.

I’m so fucked up and I have no idea why. I feel like I have no hope in finding love. I don’t know what to do. I know I’m the problem but I’m really asking for someone to please understand.

I think I have a lot of jealously of others' success, feeling guilty and hate myself a lot. I'm such a shame of this world. I'm such a useless scum. Disgrace of my family. No matter how hard I try or cry my works never be good enough. I feel disappointed in myself. I practice a lot to improve them but there are a lot of people better than me. I just feel so neglected by others and myself. Not just online but in real life is worse.

I want to stop my misery mindsets but they keep appearing whatever I breath. I can't get rid of it even I took a lot of medicines. I'm scared if I can't hold it anymore. I'm scared if someday I lose my mind and grab the razor to cut away my vein, die peacefully and I don't have to feel anymore.

It was my dad's 65th birthday, who passed a few years ago.

The looming recession has me worried as I'm the only breadwinner in the house and I make a considerable amount of money, but we have poor saving habits. A lot of my non-retirement savings are in a low-medium investment account so I should have about $10k in there but it has dropped to about $7k. I make $13k/mo for comparison. My company also did a large layoff recently and I was spared, but it's a highly subscribe business. I also have about $3k in Robinhood that has just been building a tiny bit over time since 2018. That's doing about as well as you'd expect. 

My mother in law and niece just moved in and are looking for a place here since we live in a different and nicer state with a lower than average Cost of Living, but the MIL is lazy and doesn't work and my niece is too young. 

My grandma just had a big health scare of cancer, but thankfully that was negative. She has been my rock my entire life and regardless of the negative result, it's a simple fact she's nearing the end of hers. 

I don't leave the house for months at a time because I just don't have anywhere to go. I work from home.

I started a side business about a year ago that my wife promised to help with, but doesn't do anything I don't specifically ask her to do. I can't do this with my normal job.

I recently just got over COVID that my daughter brought home. This also made me miss a work trip I had been looking forward to for several months. 

And there are a few more things I could list but you get the point. It's overwhelming. 

I'm not suicidal, but I do suffer from depression and take meds for it, but I was actually kind of sad COVID didn't take me. I'm not afraid of death, but I could never kill myself because I couldn't do that to my daughter. Plus, I wouldn't want to risk insurance money that would give her a decent chance at life. 

And big thing is I can't find joy in anything. Everything I enjoy, I can't find anyone on my level that I can connect with and I am an ENFP. What I mean by that is that they are way beyond or behind me. Most of those who I do connect with are online.

I just don't know how to handle it. I don't know what to do. I can't concentrate on work and it's getting rough. I have suicidal ideation, but only in ways that are out of my control. 

I'm afraid to bring it up with my doctor because I don't want to lose my anxiety meds or have something worse happen.

It’s 4 am in my country when I type this text about my life. 
My whole life been a struggle and a mess since I was born, my father is an alcoholic, drug addict and my mother is a very toxic, depressed woman. I only have bad memories of my childhood, teenage life, almost my whole life. 
My older sister has never been there for me and I was all alone in the household of pain and tears. 
Now I’m 22 years old and my life is getting worse every day I am alive. 
I can’t afford an own flat because of these very high prices that’s why I still live with my mother (my parents are separated for some years now). 
I never had support in my life and I have been hustling on my own since I can think. I remember getting beat up by my dad after getting out of mental health hospital because I asked him if he can join the last day where we all sat to eat cake and drink coffee. 
I remember my mother insulting me, shouting at me when I was only 5 years old and I couldn’t sleep because I had nightmares because I saw my dad shouting, beating the walls on drugs and attacking my mother several times.
I was always called a pussy or how I want to become a man if I can’t even sleep alone without crying everynight like a baby.

I had way more traumatic situations in my life but I think I can’t type it here..

My older sister never really cared for me when I asked her as a child if I can go with her because I have always been a very lonely human being. I still am I never had friends or something, I always got beat up or insulted because I never had nice clothes , vacation, and I am ugly btw
I never had hobbies because my whole life was survival mode I never had the opportunity to do or learn something.

I only remember when I was around 7, my older sister  (15 ) back then used me for her sexual pleasure , since then really My ability to feel love or anything got destroyed.

With 17 I found my girlfriend and I’m still with her but we have after 5 years of relationship massive problems. She feels like I don’t give her enough love even though I do everything I can.. she said I am not allowed to talk about my dark past with her or about my current difficult life situation because I am destroying her happy mid twenties lifestyle. She is always crying and complaining that other couples have a way better relationship. Is it to much to ask for a girlfriend that understands me and allows me to talk about my problems? 
She is btw from a very wealthy household and I am just this lonely, poor, without real family / friends mfer.
I don’t know what I can do even my therapist said to me he can’t help me because he’s overwhelmed..

I tried everything to get a better life even tho I got beat up in school, at home and insulted. I was a straight A student because with good grades I will come out of this hell. But it didn’t helped and for college I had no money..

I tried everything to make money but everything failed miserably…(crypto, stocks, e-commerce etc)

Now I’m 22, I have trauma, depression, relationship problems, my mother is now seriously sick, my sister is in a mental hospital, my dad is the devil and I don’t know how and why I should continue…

(It begins with my original story on Brainspotting, and concludes with a 3 month update below, outlining how I feel now, why EMDR didnt work for me before and why EMDR works for me now)

&amp;#x200B;

I am writing this the night of my first mind blowing experience with this therapy. 

&amp;#x200B;

4 years of talk therapy for me did nothing. (Results may vary for each person. It may work for you, it just didn’t for me). 

&amp;#x200B;

So I looked into EMDR, because it was hailed as the best for PTSD and especially after reading “The Body Keeps the Score.” 

&amp;#x200B;

But 8 or 9 sessions in and I just wasn’t getting it. Feeling it. Just… nothing. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was about to quit yet another form of therapy. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then, my EMDR therapist said “hey, I just got certified in something called brain spotting. Wanna give it a go?” 

&amp;#x200B;

“Sure.  What is it?” 

&amp;#x200B;

She then held up a stick with a little ball on the end, looked like a magic wand. 

&amp;#x200B;

(This was Telehealth by the way.)

&amp;#x200B;

“I’m going to to move this very slowly down the screen while you think about the traumatic event we’ve been working on. When you feel something, tell me when to stop.” 

&amp;#x200B;

“Something?” I said. “Like what?” 

&amp;#x200B;

“You’ll know when you feel it,” she said.  

&amp;#x200B;

“This is total woo woo new-age bullshit I am about to waste my hard earned money on…” I thought. “But, to hell with it. Got nothing to lose.” 

&amp;#x200B;

“Just keep your head still and follow with your eyes,” she calmly said. 

&amp;#x200B;

She then proceeded to move the wand down the screen. Very slowly. 

&amp;#x200B;

Nothing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Nothing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Okay a little something. 

&amp;#x200B;

Okay there is pressure in my head. 

&amp;#x200B;

Wow, this is getting intense. 

&amp;#x200B;

My face red, and tears forming in my eyes I struggled to finally say “right there.” 

&amp;#x200B;

I felt it coming to the surface. 

&amp;#x200B;

She did the same horizontally across the screen. 

&amp;#x200B;

Nothing, nothing, then BAM! A new spot. 

&amp;#x200B;

After a couple other movements across the screen that yielded nothing, she asked which of the two previous spots felt stronger. 

&amp;#x200B;

I chose the one, where the little ball rested just below her chin.  

&amp;#x200B;

For the next 40 minutes, in total complete silence, she held the wand in that position and I just stared at it. 

&amp;#x200B;

It was an emotional explosion!  I cried like I never had in therapy before. The event would come to the forefront of my mind and I could literally feel it “working it’s way forward and out!” 

&amp;#x200B;

I cried so much staring at that ball that snot was pouring out my nose as i deep weeped. 

&amp;#x200B;

My mind started with what I felt was my top trauma, then it suddenly shifted to my brothers death - which was 5 years ago and I felt I had handled it well at the time, all things considered. 

&amp;#x200B;

But my brain was now telling me that I hadn’t processed it yet. 

&amp;#x200B;

And now it was time to do that. 

&amp;#x200B;

Suddenly, I balled like a child. My subconscious showed me that I had blamed  myself partly for his passing - because I wasn’t there to help him. 

&amp;#x200B;

I went from surprise, to sadness, to anger, then … self forgiveness. 

&amp;#x200B;

Actual, real, self forgiveness. 

&amp;#x200B;

There really wasn’t anything I could have done to prevent it. And suddenly, I embodied that feeling deeply. 

&amp;#x200B;

My emotions oscillated on extremes for the entire 40 minutes. My mind was … FIXING THE BURIED! 

&amp;#x200B;

And all I did WAS STARE AT A BALL ON THE END OF A STICK! 

&amp;#x200B;

What??????

&amp;#x200B;

More was done in silence in 40 minutes than 4 years of talking. 

&amp;#x200B;

And I could just simply FEEL it working. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can’t explain it, but I was just more clear in my head afterwards. Lighter.  

&amp;#x200B;

My therapist gently smiled and said “I think we found the modality that works for you.” 

&amp;#x200B;

I cried even more when she said that. 

&amp;#x200B;

Because I knew she was right. I felt like I had reached my therapy “home,” at last. 

&amp;#x200B;

It was brutal and hard- and thats how i knew it was where my healing journey was about to finally begin. 

&amp;#x200B;

I booked her for weekly visits for two months out, wiped the snot from my nose, cancelled my appointments for the rest of the day and went for a walk in the sun - my mind clear and face grinning for the first time in ages. :)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

07/27/22 UPDATE:

&amp;#x200B;

Hey all! Sorry for the delay. Going through a move to a new city but wanted to update you guys on my progress.

&amp;#x200B;

I have to say, I’ve felt … different. Better, different. Anixety is down 50-60% and depression has also subsisded to similar levels.

&amp;#x200B;

Sessions 1-4, were intense, non stop crying for long bouts. 5-7 was about 1/2 crying and “trauma work out.” And last session was … no crying.

&amp;#x200B;

I was shocked.

&amp;#x200B;

So shocked that i said “okay, let’s try EMDR.”

&amp;#x200B;

That’s when I found out what I was doing “wrong” with EMDR before and why it wasn’t working.

&amp;#x200B;

She moved her wand across the screen at a steady back and forth pace for up to 10 minutes. Somewhere along minute 6 or 7 I could feel the trauma coming forward, same as brain spotting (though not as intense now given my precious brain spotting sessions). 

&amp;#x200B;

It turns out, EMDR didn’t work before because the therapists would only have me following the light or finger (or pulse pads) for at most 30 seconds. It never felt like enough time to dig deep.

&amp;#x200B;

And this therapist showed me that different brains need different amounts of time to process the movement.

&amp;#x200B;

So now we have shifted to EMDR for a couple sessions to see what we can “work out” still. I won’t stop until 30 minutes of spotting or EMDR produces nothing.  And I feel oh so close! Perhaps only a month or so away.

&amp;#x200B;

Before, I was having numerous bouts of autistic levels of “stimmings,” extreme agoraphobia where I couldn’t leave my bed for fear of, well, everything, and my brain was so pressurized with trauma, I could cry at moment on any day, and this was almost every day since the incident that catalyzed all these feelings. (I was incarcerated in another country for a crime I didn’t commit, and was treated quite horribly as a result, placed in solitary confinement with no books or outside world contact, only to be proven innocent months later, once all the damage was done). 

&amp;#x200B;

I still have anxieties, and pace the room sometimes, but it’s about 80% less than it used to be.

&amp;#x200B;

So I would call that a HUGE win.

&amp;#x200B;

I know how hard it can be to find a good therapist. But honestly, while mine is amazing, this therapy kind of does the work itself, you just need to make sure you are with someone that is 

A) trained in it (obviously)

B) one you can trust being vulnerale with when the emotions (and snot and tears) come pouring forth. 

If EMDR failed in the past, just ask the therapist to do the bilateral motion longer. If the therapist gets physically tired of moving their finger back and forth, ask for the pulse pads or that they use a wand with a ball on it and to place it propped against the edge of the desk so they can swivel it like pendulum, keeping its motion consistent and not wearing out the therapist’s arm.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel light bars might be best here, at least for me.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope this update inspires some of you who didn’t “feel” EMDR working or wanted another option to talk therapy.

&amp;#x200B;

It does work.

&amp;#x200B;

It sounds so new agey. Or bogus.

&amp;#x200B;

But man, after years of talk therapy, this is the only thing that made me function again. It was like digging up the traumatic roots inside my brain. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hope all of you find the emotional comfort you deserve.

&amp;#x200B;

You are worth it.

&amp;#x200B;

You can get better.

&amp;#x200B;

The chains can be broken.

I have relied for many years on distractions to avoid self reflection but the only ones that work are failing. I have in the past taken time to analyse my life but it leaves me so numb i can barely think straight to the point I accidentally injured myself pretty badly and didnt feel it. My thoughts recently have taken a dark turn as well as I realised I was more or less groomed from age 5 (i am 27 now) to help the favourite childs goals and heavily steered me away from independent goals to the point i dont even know how to set one now. It also doesn't help that I realised I have been bisexual for nearly 15 years that i can recall and that my mother was extremely homophobic up until recently so monosexism screwed with my head for years and years. What hurts the most is i know my family have dealt with issues thanks to my abusive father so any time I bring up issues they always make it seem like its a drop in the sea compared to what they had to deal with so i have bottled up a lot and i refuse to talk about it for fear of being made to feel even more insignificant. I cant avoid the toxicity as i cant afford to move out but at this point I struggle seeing why I should remain in this life as the stepping stone of someone else, that someone else is my sister who is much older than me and about the only one i get along with and i dont blame her for it as it wasnt her choice but my other siblings treat me like a joke a lot of the time like i am just some waste of space and my parents are in my opinion not worth worrying about. Everything i do even if i am praised for it at this point feels disingenuous like anyone could do what I do and that nothing I do matters but videogames and books seemed to fill that void allowing me to live a life i wasnt able to in reality but lately that comfort is slipping away from me. My dogs make me feel like i have a family of my own and thankfully they still remain precious to me. These escapes are the only reason I am still able to force myself out of bed each day but lately I wonder if my resolve has finally begun its final descent into that numb abyss again.

Oh and this is gonna be really rambly and ranty, probably won't make sense at all but eh

When I really young, I just ate everything in sight. It made me happy and I was constantly told I could just lose the weight later. I was always the ""funny"" weird kid in class, constantly making jokes and being gross for laughs. People around school knew my name but that was about it. 

I'm not quite sure what happened, but going into 7th grade time felt like it suddenly slowed around me. I hated the reputation I dragged around for my entire childhood and I hated my body. At first it was manageable and my parents were actually proud of me for improving my behavior (becoming self aware). It kind of went fully off the rails in freshman year of highschool. I lost a decent amount of the weight I had to the point of being at some weird middle point between chubby in a ""cute"" way and just straight up fat, which is better than staying the way I was I suppose. 

I began to really hate myself. It got really bad, but I always thought that it would get better and I just needed to keep exercising and watching my calories. (It didn't get better).

Come sophomore year and I hit the roughest depression bought I've been through. I spent the entire winter of that year eating like shit, losing friends, and trying to ignore all my issues, but I couldn't for long. I began self harm that year, too. I regained a lot of weight but luckily I didn't really look like I gained any. I met some cool friends, but it was all surface level shallow friendships that wouldn't go anywhere.

 I spent every single day begging the world to kill me because I was too scared to do anything myself. Things really never got better since then, but I guess I adapted to it. I'm still seen as the funny chubby kid who everyone in class ""knows"" but no one really knew. I cut my middle school friends off because we all grew in vastly different directions and ever since I've been completely alone. Time feels like it has crawled to a stop since then. Days go by and I swear I can feel every grueling second like it's a needle going into my arm, but I can never recall anything that happens in hindsight. I stopped taking meds completely because they never helped me and plan on pretty much repeating the same shit next year. I don't know what I'll do with myself when I graduate, but there's time to think it out from now till then.

I struggle with depression since several years. I'm 29, male. When I stay sober my mood automatically becomes stable. Not good, not bad. It's simply stable and neutral.

When I drink alcohol, my mood very quickly changes to become very positive. My depressive thoughts vanish immediately. 

When I drink I can't moderate, because I crave this positive feeling so bad. I drink 1 beer and quickly drink 4-9 beers. I can't stop, because I love feeling so ""alive"" and happy. I drink 1 beer, I want more and more until I feel the buzz.

The next day I always experience a deep depression. Everything turned to shit. I'm a complete wreck for 1-2 days. I always swear to myself I won't touch this poison anymore. I last for maximum 1 week until I drink again, cause I miss the positive feeling so much.

I'm the happiest, non-depressive person when I'm drunk, but the next day I'm full of anxiety and suicidal thoughts. 

Am I doomed to stay sober for the rest of my life? How did you manage that? 
It's so hard to stay sober. I crave the feeling almost everyday and in society it's so widespread everywhere.

Is there a chemical/scientific explanation for this? How can it be that alcohol affects depressive people so bad? What is the scientific explanation for this? I don't understand how this chemical can affect my entire brain so quickly?

I know these things aren’t mutually exclusive, you can be certain of death and still do something with your life; but for some reason is holds me back. I spend most of my time wishing to be dead, trying to lose weight, watching the same shows over and over again, reading… life is so monotonous and I hate it. Even when I try to do something different I just end up laying awake at night thinking about when it will finally be my turn to rest.

I have a life, too. I have a good relationship with my friends and most of my family. I guess I don’t have a good relationship with myself, with food, with my body, with my sexuality…I have goals and aspirations but at the end of the day I just want to watch tv and eat garbage. I’ve never had a significant other either because I’m too afraid.

I have to constantly make sure my body isn't decaying while it's still in use, I have to clean every inch of my house if I don't want asbestos to take over, I live in the US so I'll never be able to move out let alone into a house that I actually like, and even if I did it feels like the world is ending so what's the point.

It doesn't take that entire block of text to get the idea. I hate existing. The pros and cons list of living just doesn't add up and I don't get it. Why does everyone care so much about staying alive? I'll hurt all of 20 people if I check out early, and the world will go on without me. I don't get it, how do I make life worth living?

The freezing night that enveloped the city seemed to have gone on so long that it would never end.

When his daughter asked him if it would ever be day again, something changed in him.

He reached a decision. He couldn’t stand the darkness for another minute.

”If we go fast enough, we can catch dawn.”

They sold everything they owned and bought a bus. Someone was always awake in this city. Soon they had passengers - the hopeless, the depressed, the lost, from every walk of life.

Starting off slow, he set off in the right direction and felt his despair turn into a sense of purpose. He had forgotten what it was like to have hope.

“We’ll never catch dawn at this pace,” said a haggard passenger.

He picked up speed. He knew the city was still gasping for breath, but you’d never know it from the dilapidated buildings, dark, unmaintained streets, and empty chill in the air. It was impossible to determine which buildings were abandoned and which contained people who still believed in this place. The roads were frozen solid, but he had no trouble driving on them.

By the time he reached downtown, he had maxed out his speedometer, but still, his passengers cheered him to go faster. It was loud on the bus, as they urged him on with exhilaration and the wind shrieked past the windows.

They exited the city a short while later, having broken the sound barrier.

The bus hurtled down empty road after empty road, finally reaching the highway. Still, he pushed the bus even faster. It felt like they were on a roller coaster. They traveled across the country at break neck acceleration.

The people fed on each other's rising energy, feeling as though they understood each other and were understood themselves. They were so healed by the increasing spirit of well being on the bus as they hurtled closer to daylight that it was like a meal to the starving.

Five minutes after they exceeded the fastest speed ever achieved by any kind of vehicle on Earth, they caught dawn.

I wont’t sit here and tell you all the cliches about how it gets better. That’s not what I’ve learned. Life didn’t get better, I got better. I got stronger. I looked at myself in the mirror at rock bottom multiple times and realized I was living life as someone else. Someone i’d let the world lie and tell me I was until I believed it. I never forgot any of the pain…I took it all on the chest until something in me, the little bit of me that was still in the mirror and clinging on from the darkness pulling me down, said no more. And I buried my demons in a 6 foot grave with a marble headstone.

I’ve done this more than once too. It’s never just “over”. But you start to learn new moves when you fight more fights.

It breaks my heart seeing you all like this. I have this drive in me now to just take people’s pain, seeing them say they hate life just like I used to but knowing how good I felt when I beat it.

I really love my wife and I know that depression is affecting your ability to function like a normal person on a daily life where things like doing chores feels like mountain to overcome.   


Reason why I am asking for advice is because I've really reached my limit and I can't take care of two people (her and me) at the same time and it exhausted me to the point that it affects my mental health.  


To start off and without giving much details about our private lives:  
My wife had a rough childhood, her older siblings forced her to do all the chores around he house like a maid, her mother suffered from breast cancer (than brain cancer) and passed away when she was an older teen, her father left the family when she was still very young because of the constat conflicts her family had and still have to this day.  
She is basically all alone and the only person left to help her in need is her older sister.  


We moved away from my parents house because of the toxic relationship I've had with my father and we live ever since in a very small apartment.  


The main issue I have with my wife is her depression affecting her taking responsibility we all have to in this society we're living. She is the sweetest wife I've known, I really love the craftmanship she can make herself, I really love her when she is caring, when we laugh, when we play video games together etc.  


But in the recent years, her mental health becomes worse and worse with no sign of improvement. She takes her same anti depressant since almost 3 years and confirmed to me she is afraid to stop taking them.  


She is unable to do chores, sleeps all day and wakes up at noon, plays video games or is making some keychains, plushies, cooks when she remembers she is hungry. That's mostly her basic routine.  
Before Covid, around June 2019, she quit her half time job in order to open her own sewing shop despite we had no financial means to do that and she informed that she quit at the same day she gave her resignation (she told me few weeks ago she planned to quit but I begged her to do that when we had enough money on the side so we would be better prepared)  


Ever since than, I had to micromanage our finance to pay for food, bill, rent and everything else. Her sewing shop didn't start off good since we had literally no money on our bank account to kickstart her project and ever since than, she had only around a dozen customers from people she knows personally.

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing that really bothers me are the chores, as I type this, they are dirty clothes, dishes, trash, dust, pets cage hasn't been cleaned properly for months and random stuff around our apartment scattered around in every direction.  


I really try my best to do the chores to help her out but working full time and arriving exhausted at home, I don't have much time and energy to do all the chores. We had already many arguments about this and I always get blamed that I am lazy and do nothing as well (like her) despite I am the only of us two who has a steady income else we would be homeless by now. I want to help her doing the chores but she always want to do it when I am there. I understand her that she feels more motivated if I am there but I've tried explaining to her many times that I can't be there for her 24h/24h and that she has to try her best to do sth on her own.  


I have to constantly remind her that they are dirty dishes sitting for 3 days, if our pets are fed, if we have clean clothes etc and she complains every time to me why I am repeating myself (it's because it's the same vicious cycle repeating)  


Same goes for searching help, therapy and other things, she always waits for me to do sth for her. I have to call for her to assign appointments to a psychologue, therapy, paperwork etc.   


She tells me she can't do it on her own but even her own Psychiatrist and Therapist told her after years of help that they can't do much if she herself doesn't do sth to improve herself.  


Basically she wants other people help her to walk on her own path but we can't because it hers not ours (it's really hard to explain it in words). She still hasn't figured out how to live with her depression and is constantly fighting it, calling it ""her monster"" that she wants to get rid off despite me trying explaining her that she has to learn to live with and not against it because that monster it's herself, it's her own mind not being well telling her lies that she is not worth it and has to give up.

I basically have the feeling that I have to babysit her or that I have to live as 2 person at the same time.  


We had many talks but every time we talk about existential topics like getting a job, money, cleaning the house not to get sick etc she gets mad, frustrated and other negative emotions that she ends up getting aggressive.  


I am aware that I am giving her to much pressure and that I am impatient, but time passes and we are just getting older and older (we're in our early 30s and have been together since almost 10 years).  


Everything is way to much for me and already suffered from Burnout since last year and I am at my end.  
I don't want to divorce with her, because I am aware of the problems we both have.  


I really just need some advice on how to improve our lives in order that we both have a nice clean apartment that's also kept that way, how do I motivate her to do sth on her own without me her constantly reminding her to empty the trash bin when it's overflowing with thrash on the side or clean the sink if it's stinks like rotten flesh.

&amp;#x200B;

I really love her and I wouldn't never leave her alone, she is aware that she has a mental problem but she relies way to much on me to help her despite I myself struggle with my own mental problems and exhaustion.  


If some things might be confusing to you, that may be because I wrote this in the middle of the night and I am just so tired right now.

what is an ace-stoma?  
 To create an ACE stoma, the surgeon will cut off the appendix, still with its blood supply, and connect one end to the large bowel and the other end to the wall of the abdomen at the navel or lower down below the level of most underwear. This small opening or stoma is used to pass a tube called a catheter into the bowel so that fluid can be introduced to flush faeces out through the anus. This is called an ACE washout. For people who have previously had their appendix removed, there are other ways of making an ACE stoma. For example, a tiny segment of small bowel may be used. Before the operation, you may be admitted to the hospital for a few days. This is to make sure you are well enough to have the operation, and to empty the bowel.

Have been experiencing a pretty bad slump of depression again since I've recently fallen very ill. My mood has absolutely plummeted and I've been crying everyday thinking about my life. 

I'm 23, living in a big city, and recently got a job that is a big deal for me. It's a full time permanent position with benefits, though it still pays pretty meekly for city standards. I feel like my life is already over though. I think that I haven't fallen into any luck prior, and now my fate is sealed. 

I've never had a stable adult relationship. I've had a few situationships and highschool romances but that's about it. I've been dating for years but 70% of the time I don't like them/we don't have much in common and 30% of the time they don't like me. All my friends have been in extremely long relationships (7 couples, 2 year minimum and 11 year maximum). I've gone on apps and into the wild approaching people. I really think it's over for me at this point. 

Which leads me into my next problem. I live with 2 roommates, 1 is going to move out soon because of conflicts with our downstairs neighbours. She declared it but I am fairly certain because she's been bringing it up repeatedly. It's going to be extremely stressful to find a new roommate especially with this bitter relationship downstairs and as a result, with my landlord. I can't afford to live on my own. 

I failed my driver's license test for a second time. I feel so stupid and terrible about it. It's so expensive to book the tests and rent a car too. This has added to my self loathing at my inability to do a normal adult function like getting my license. 

Everyday I try my best. I have regularly volunteered at different community organizations. Prior to my illness, I worked out very regularly. I have several hobbies I like to do but nothing has appealed to me as of late. I don't know how I'm supposed to survive out here. My career wouldn't make sense in a smaller city, but I just got to this new position so I can't be hopping around already. Everyday I just cry myself to sleep and think about how I'm alone and failure, and how it feels like it'll stay like this forever.",True,False,False,depression,t5_2qqqf,886240,public,confidence,self,Could someone encourage me please?

This has mainly been caused by my lack of meaningful relationships in my life and my mostly self imposed isolation. 

Most of my high school friends have either moved or fallen out of touch with me, and I find it extremely difficult to make any new ones. Meeting new people honestly terrifies me and I can’t bring myself to it, however the few times I have made acquaintances in the last year they never blossomed into a real friendship. I want to have friends and go out and do things with people, but at the same time I’m too scared and ignorant on how to go about that. I’ve never had a girlfriend and embarrassingly enough am still a virgin. I feel like I could find one but I am just too timid and socially anxious in order to even try.

Besides my social life I go to a community college and just finished my freshman year, however I have no career aspirations or goals so school feels unnecessary and a waste of money (lucky enough to have my parents fund it). I haven’t had a job in over 6 months and while I’ve had several interviews overs the past few weeks, none of them panned out.

About 3 months ago I fell deep into depression. I’ve always had it but this time J started getting close to suicide. 

Half the time I think “I’d do anything to get help. I’ll work hard. It’s possible for me to change. I may be able to be happy for the first time.” 

The rest of the time I want to die. I think about how I have been nothing but a suffering freak my entire life and how expecting it to change is a joke. A fairy tale. How could I change? Why should I change? If I’m alone as is maybe I should stay alone and just end it. 

I become angry that it seems everyone is happy with me alone and suffering but the moment I bring up ending it they clutch their pearls. They pull the “oh my stars, *everyone* would feel bad and miss you.”

When I was first depressed that made me feel bad. Now though, fuck them. They deserve to have a taste of my entire shit life. 

Boo fucking hoo. You’re son killed yourself after you treated him like a dog and fucked with his head. Forcing him to live the life you wanted if you weren’t a stupid shit who couldn’t wrap your cock or close your legs. 

I have no idea why I don’t kill myself. I just don’t see myself doing it. Maybe because its a change. I never change. 

Getting better or ending it. I can’t do neither so I’m here being pathetic.

I want to say thank you to those who listen to me. Here is some background information about me for some context and storytelling purposes. 

I’m a 15 year old who has 4 other siblings ( 1 blood related, and 3 step siblings ) mainly raised by my grandma because of my mom working. My dad left when I was 6-7 and my brother was 2-3, I don’t remember exactly when but it was around that time. My step father came into the picture when I was 9. We live in an above average house considering our area and live in a rural area. I go to high school which has been better than middle school for me and I’m about to enter my Junior year ( 11th grade ).

My grandma passed away in November of 2020 due to ovarian cancer and had been fighting it for about a year and a half. This kickstarted most events, I became severely depressed then numb during the holiday season. I had fallen down another hole like I had when I was in middle school. ( I had been over at my boyfriend at the times house and he tried to make moves on me while I told him no and that I didn’t want to do anything. He touched me but luckily it never got worse than that. ( I had tried to commit suicide by slitting my throat with a knife ) ) I’ve been carrying this grief for the past two years and it’s coming to a climax. I feel like I’ve lost all control over my own actions I can’t be by myself without my head going blank then following with graphic thoughts. It’s been like this for the past few months, my boyfriend and best friend have seen my absolute worst and have endured my explosive episodes. I’ve told my parents and they try to convince me that therapy won’t work. I don’t want to take anti depressants ( I can’t swallow pills it triggers me ) I’m sick of being stuck and I’ve put myself into a position where I can’t help myself without hurting people I love. I can’t think of anything else that would break my heart more. But I can’t keep going at the same time, I don’t have access to sharp objects like pocket knifes, box cutters, etc. I don’t like being near dangerous objects anymore considering the black outs and gaining consciousness to find out that I hurt myself.

Crazy huh? I went through my whole 20's without anyone.

I don't consider it a cause of depression as much as a result of it. At one point I was feeling depressed over girls, but at this point it's something I just get over when I think of it.

It felt worse to me to have unfulfilled romantic interests than to just be so far removed from the game that I don't even have a person in mind. I was hurting over someone in my teenage years that probably could have gone worse than it did. It still went pretty badly, but we did get together eventually and had a good year and a half with it, but that ended and it's practically impossible for me to have a relationship that fills that void. Now when I think about relationships, it's something I'd rather forget than something I'm looking forward to.

At this point, I don't think it'll ever happen again. What, am I going to start hooking up with baby mamas and divorcees when I haven't even had a girlfriend since before I turned 21? I'm not that desperate, and I don't have the maturity to handle certain aspects of adult life as-is.

I don't think I really care enough. Maybe I do just look at women 'pieces of meat'. But from my experience, that's how they look at themselves too. They know how much their lumps of fat are worth and put them out on the market for the highest price they can get for it. And that's how it is, so I don't think it's worth even trying to win one over, with all the BS that goes along with them.

I don't know, not trying to be offensive or anything. Maybe it's best to keep it to myself.

Should I cut ties with my parent?

For as long as I can remember, I haven’t had the best relationship with my parent. I wont say which one, but the fact is that even if I love my parent, and absolutely admire a lot of their traits, I have an immense fear when it comes to that parent. There has never been any physical harm or anything (dont worry) however this parent has got clear anger issues. Not just against me, but most people around them. My fear has evolved, from me having an terrible self esteem because the things said to me hit home really bad, and now that I have been to therapy for around 3 years I dont have self esteem problems, but my fear is confusing now. 

My parents decided to get a divorce around 2 years ago, and it has been a nightmare. Me and my sibilings have been in the middle of it for the whole thing. We have even been witnesses at the first (and up till now, only) trial. This has been terrible for my mental health, to the point that I have attempted suicide. I am aware of the dangers of this so I decided to get extra help on the matter, and I am currently on more therapy and with a bunch of measures in place. 
About 18 months ago after a suicide attempt I told this parent whom i fear, about it. I told the parent about me having this fear, and told him I would be attending therapy. Their reaction was horrible (although I do empathize in the sense that sometimes he projects worry through anger, but Im still not justifying it). They told me I was a liar, and unfair, that I was selfish. They made an emphasis on how terrible it would have been if I succeeded because “how would I tell your other parent about this”. For a month I didnt see this parent and I was for a while out of the divorce matters. I no longer recieved the emails from lawyers and it seemed like I had finally gotten myself out of it. Until the first trial. I was put as a witness and once again I was in the middle. A few months later I traveled abroad to begin uni, and for most of the year things were really amazing. Just once, when this parent came to visit did I have to once again go through the same anger episodes. It seems like our relationship only works when Im away. I came home for the summer, came as late as I could and am leaving as esrly as I can, but as soon as I saw my parent things went downhill again. And it seems like each time its a bit worse. Comments are more hurtful and language is less censored. Questioning my manhood just because I dont want to get involved in the divorce matters, comparing me to my other parents lawyer and saying Im even worse, “lying shi*”, etc. to the point that last time I visited, I was there for less than 72 hours and my parent got mad at me 4 times. Each time my parent is mad it is at least an hour of telling off.

My parent however is someone I love, someone who has worked very hard for my family and I truly appreciate that. Clearly, there is a lot of love for my siblings and I. The reason my siblings and I have been part of the divorce (in part) is that the goods being fought for are someday going to be ours. My parent wants us to fight for “our rights” because if not, they will be taken from us, perhaps stolen by my other parent. 

I recently sent two letters to my parent, as talking face to face is just incredibly hard for me, plus as my parent may sometimes forget things, its good to have it written. I wrote the letters with all the love I have for him. I dont hate him or hold any kind of grudge against him, and I even asked someone I trust to read them over and make sure that the letters came from a place of love. In the first one, I simply asked to be left out of the whole problem, I even said I had no problem with being disowned (regardless of whether it would happen or not), because my mental health or my relationship with each parent are priceless. My parent misunderstood my letter completely and in my opinion just placed a ‘roadblock’ so I couldnt get out of the problem. I sent another one clarifying my points and saying I was not the one getting a divorce, and I love both too much to be a part of the divorce. This time around my parent simply replied something that had nothing to do with what I said, and told me that they never asked me to lie or anything, and that they just wanted my siblings and I to help guide my parents (which I dont disagree with, he did say that, but that still affected my mental health greatly). I simply did not reply to that one because silence is sometimes wise. I said all I had to say.

I love my parent but for similar reasons to mine, my parent has lost many friends and even family relationships, and of course a divorce.

However I dont know if I should cut ties with that parent. My close friends, who know about this have told me to do so, even my therapist, after 3 years of looking for ways to make my relationship with him work. I am however very scared of doing so. I know if I do, it will probably be best for my headspace, but it would maybe be permanent, or quite permanent. My parent has lost family ties and even with the other parties trying to reach out, my parent holds too many grudges to even try and fix things. Also however, since a couple of goods have been partially put to me and my sibilings name, I am afraid my life may be hard in that sense, as I will still be legally bound to that parent in some way. I also have no idea how I would phrase the letter. Recently my parent has been very nice and has told me 
they miss me and all as we havent seen each other in a few weeks.

I just want to get this off my chest and ask your opinion about the topic. Some of you, or maybe the most of you have already been in my situation before or have felt this way once or twice.

My problem is, that I've been in a relationship for 6+ years now with a girl I really love, I'd really want to be with for the rest of my life and want to do everything together. However, I'm not sexually attracted to her anymore. Partly because I was a late bloomer, I'm kind of that introverted type that was never OK around girls, which is the reason why I didn't have any relationship up until my mid 20's. I had a few short adventures with some girls, then got into my first relationship that lasted for half a year, and after another half year being single, I met my current girlfriend and we've been together for more than 6 years.

What I feel I'd describe as, she doesn't attract me sexually, and I still feel like I have too little experience to settle down. I was always an overweight and insecure, non-confident person, which I have changed in the last 6-10 years. Right now I feel like I could do whatever I want, with whomever I want. I feel that I could overcome this feeling and settle down, like most of my friends have already, think of having a family, a home, etc. But I can't forget the feeling, that our sex-life is very bad due to what I've mentioned earlier.

I love this girl, but the feeling that I can't move on because of how our sex-life never made me happy, and I know that it'll probably never make me happy, is making me so depressed... Meanwhile we are getting older, she is only a few years away from getting 30, which makes me feel like a douchebag, knowing that I am only wasting her time. My time as well, but I'm OK with messing up my life. I don't want to mess up hers. During the 6+ years I've never thought about marrying her, mainly because of my mixed feeling about our future, or how this relationship could come to an end... You just simply can't marry someone, only if you are 110% sure, that she IS the one.

I'm getting more and more depressed and don't know what I should do. I try to convince myself that it could work, that I could get sexually attracted to her, or more likely lose sexual attraction to other girls, and by doing so convince myself, that she is my partner for life. Based on every other aspect, I'd definitely want to marry her. But this feeling of her not being happy with me sexually, is standing in the way...

Anyways, thanks for reading through all of this...

I’m 29m. 
I’ve been depressed for around 6 years now. 
All started with too much negativity going on for me when I was ~23/24 years old. 
Girlfriend, Job, Friends, Family related things + with 24 a emergency surgery (open heart surgery because somehow some germs decided to eat that tasty heart valve of mine).
Actually I haven’t had a slight chance to survive the doctors told me but they did a good job and someone in heaven or somewhere else too (my whole life I always told people how lucky I am and fuck yeah this came from the bottom of my heart! and life went mostly really great). 
But boom, this life changed 180 degrees and went downhill. 

Always thought I can stand the man I was but couldn’t do hard work anymore, couldn’t do the sports I like, couldn’t go out partying and doing activities the same way, suddenly problems to get close to women, etc… 
All because I had the fear to get weak and dependent after the surgery. 
And because of this fear and being self-pity at one point, I slowly became everything I didn’t wanted to be and more. Even though I did a lot like visiting psychiatrist, doctors, etc. 
I jumped deep down this numb place with all of it’s facets called depression, this fucking parasite.

Now I believe the only way out of this numb shithole is to admit to myself that I am weak, weak for the moment. It costed me alot of courage to reveal this to others (but mostly to my broken inner self).
The journey doesn’t stop here, rather it is the start of something new the old ego tried to suppress all the time.



I think that’s how we get depressed.
The whole situation does not suit the ego (the old you)—

(Sometimes it’s definitely too much for a human, this is why it’s ok to ask for help, no matter how old you are, female or male - specialy male! - , we all need help at a certain point of life!)

-- until you admit to this situation and going to chance it.
Sometimes you need to get depressed just to internalize the life lesson you’ve got blessed with. 
Time doesn’t matter, we’re growing in our own paces. 
Hard to do in such a fast racing society but it’s worth it!

I’m at my restart now. The future is blurry, it always has been but somehow it is ok again.

Now seeing my ex graduate college with her newest bf and get a “serious” job and be a real adult I’m sort of envious and bitter. And it sort of Stunts me because I’ve become self loathing and self critical. And think I deserve living at my parents , single, and being aimless some days this type of thinking makes me want to give up and contemplate suicide. 
I have no fun in my life I’d like to meet more women and start having sex again. I also want to find a career and make some sort of living despite my learning problems and education level.

Now, my question is:

If somehow, that tweezer got infected with a virus, std, etc., What kind of infections am I in risk of getting? HIV, HPV, Chlamydia? Is this a risky situation? Is 35-36 days enough for any virus to completely die if it was on that tweezer?

I'm trans and a girl so obviously his comments made me feel sick and I was in shock and completely dissociated. While he... laughed at what he was saying?

I posted on the meeting's page that I was upset by some comments I heard at this meeting. I didn't name him. He (convincingly) came in the thread and called me a liar and a fantasist who ""heard what she wanted to hear."" I said I'm not a liar but some people sided with him while others messaged me privately to side with me. So now there's public humiliation where I'm being described as overemotional and unforgiving, on top of feeling just... rejected/hurt.

It's all so silly. I don't know this man but he affected me so much. I've called my mom about it. I've spoken to friends about it, and I still don't feel any better. I've heard every variation, ""he's an idiot, you can't fix stupid"" and ""I'm so sorry this happened to you,"" and I still don't feel any better.

I was rocking back and forth in bed this morning at four am because I felt so hurt. I've felt like detransitioning. I've felt like I made myself a target by transitioning.

These comments when you're trans and don't really think about it that much, really get under your skin. I'm feeling suicidality, although I put all the sharp objects away and took my antidepressants so I'm betting on ideation remaining ideation.

I feel bad for his daughter. I feel bad for myself having to sit there and fake smile because I was afraid to say anything. I just feel so dejected.

I've accomplished a goal that I set out to do but I still have this feeling of emptiness that has been here for as long as I can remember. I remember the first time that I realized what this was. I remember thinking that this isn't something someone who has the privileges that I do can experience. I denied it and took the course of convincing myself that it's not that bad. That there are people who have it worse. 

I constantly question what the point of any of this is. I've been covering up this thing that has been weighing me down. I've always felt like this is something I'm not allowed to talk about. Like this is something someone like me should be able to put up with. You still have parents, crazyparty. You have a great future, crazyparty. You can get through this just think positively, crazyparty. These are all things I've heard repeatedly.

The most recent way this shadow has effected me was when I was at work. I helped someone fill out a government form online. I knew that they needed a confirmation page. I suggested they save the confirmation page before they left, and they were flippant about it. I know that should have insisted upon it. I didn't care. I let them leave without it. I know this is out of character for me. This depression is what created the person that let them leave and then come back to do the online form all over again just for the confirmation document. It was more work for me and I knew what I had to do to get it right the first time, but on the surface I didn't care. I wanted to get back to my work computer to distract myself with the game I was playing so I can stop thinking.

I have difficulty socializing. I have trouble eating and sleeping. I'll go the entire day without eating. I've started eating 8 to 10 hours after I wake up most days the past few years. I constantly feel like the people around me wish I were gone. I don't feel comfortable reaching out to the people I normally would (I guess what I said earlier illustrates why). I want to get help. I need to get help. I've never been on medication for this but I think that it's time. I'm scared to see the doctor.

That was 4 years ago. Now I am in a worse situation. I will always feel that I will never get rid of this illness however hard I try. Maybe therapy once again will help me but only for some time, eventually I will fall back into it in 4-5 years time. And it's so expensive in my country, I can't even afford it. All I need is someone to talk to and that is the main problem. 

My friends are the best people in my life and I love them more than anyone and they also love me. Last time, I think more than the professional help or anti-depressants, their support made me better. When I told them what I was going through, they called me regularly to check up on me, listened to my cries, rants, and my thoughts. I am grateful to them more than anyone. But at that time, we were in college so we had time for each other. 

Now we live in different cities, some even in different country. All of us have our own separate lives and all of us are busy. We talk with each other as much as we can, but that's like once in 2 months or so. I cannot tell them how bad I am once again. I don't want to put them in such a position. They are busy with their careers and I can't be one to ask them to take time out for me, because I cannot be so needy. I don't want them to listen to me when I know that they have problems of their own. They are living away from their families, alone in a strange city with not too many friends; I know everyone of them battles daily with a lot of issues. I cannot burden them with my own problems.

Everyday I am spiraling deeper and deeper in this hell. My sleep cycle is fucked, my appetite is ruined, I have lost interest in my hobbies, I don't ever feel like talking about myself to my family because living in denial is much easier than facing their concerns.

Not good at keeping personal diary or stuff so seeing some people venting here made me think maybe i can just type it all down and set it lose on strangers i never met nor will.
So this last year has been sort of one hell after another.  
Met a girl online. Fell head over heals for her and she said the same.It was all innocent love. Not even close to anything dirty or sexual since we only met and interacted over online and through texts.I'm mostly shy around girls since i never interacted with any throughout school and college so meeting someone online was ideal for me in that way. Someone naive as me who believed if you give someone all your love and care and never asked anything in return maybe things would result in an happy ever after got a rude awakening when the ""I love you too"" replies stopped coming. Even though she was the first to say it i guess i fell for it 'cause it was all new to me.
Welp she has stayed on my mind for like almost an year now with me questioning myself that why would someone even do this but i stay strong without cursing her and just accepting that i was the dumb one.
Moving on earlier this year my father passed away. I was there holding his hand when he passed. I didn't shed a single tear through out everything even though i wanted to just because i had to stay strong for my family. Now i feel like even my tears have gone dry. I don't tell anyone but it's a lot like a LOT. Well due to this i had to take a sort of break from studies so i can take over Dad's businesses. Watcing all my classmates and friends graduate,being social having girlfriends is a whole other existential crisis i get every day.Although i do plan on continuing my studies next year after i'v gotten a better grip on the bussines and have it more streamlined. 
I'm still trying my best but i'm also getting tired. I just keep strong for my families sake so that they have someone they can look too as being firm and strong and someone the can lean on.
Bunch of other stuff happened too like fam drama. Logoun ki asliyat sach mayn tub he nazar aati hay jub ghar mayn barra nahi rehta is a fact.
All in all it feels like i haven't slept in ages. My mind is in a constant state of being over clocked as in i have to be blasting music always to drown out my thoughts. 

Lonely but won't do anything about it. In pain but can't show it. Tired but can't stop. Hurt but can't heal.

I did therapy in my teens and have finally made decision to give it another shot, but needed to put something in writing. 

I’ve denied to myself and my loved ones how numb I’ve become. I’ve always been easily sucked into the dark side of my mind, I think it’s become a familiar comfort to fall into despair. I’m afraid most that the cycle of depression and anxiety has become inseparable from my self identity. I’m not sure if I know who I am without that part of myself.

The rest of the world sees me as a quiet guy who’s happily married to a phenomenal wife, two beautiful kids aged 1 &amp; 4, financially doing great, killing it at work, great parents, great friends…. Reading this sub I feel guilty even posting here knowing the blessings I have.

All I see in the mirror each day is a workaholic and neglectful husband, absentee dad, forgetful friend and family member, and overall selfish person. Somehow I also turn that self criticism into being a victim which does not help the negative way I view myself.

My daughter at 7 months old recently went through an aggressive brain infection that landed her in the hospital for a month. She could’ve died, it was the most terrifying thing I’ve ever experienced. I must’ve made a hundred deals with god trying to trade my life for hers. She’s home and healthy which is literally a miracle I’ll never understand. 

all of a sudden I went from sleeping nights at the hospital, drive home and  work 15 hours a day, breaking down every minute I was alone in fear, hiding that from my son and family, 7 days a week for a month. Then one day she comes home and the world goes back to normal.

I’ve never felt so alone, helpless, desperate. Then, it was over and people talk about it when it comes up like it was a bad bout of flu. I was already at my breaking point mentally and emotionally but I will never forget the feeling of isolation while she was going through that.

I feel like all I want to do all the time is vent to someone, but feel no one actually cares. When someone does, I only feel guilty for burdening them and regret it after. Those I do lean on either have betrayed my confidence or seem uninterested. I work more hours than I thought possible to provide for my family, yet feel like I’m never enough for either.

All day every day I feel fake. I just don’t know how much longer I can pretend. I’ve been through my fair share of shit in life, but also realize it’s nothing compared to most and I am grateful for what I have yet feel I don’t deserve it. Lately I just feel like I’ve run out of people that actually care to hear about my life let alone ask how I’m doing.

I feel isolated, I’m doing the things I always had on the priority list for life, but with each achievement just feel more and more alone. I feel the last 15 years has been a slow spiral and no one really sees how close I am to falling off the edge at any given time. 

I should be happy but I’m not and don’t V even know what that means anymore. I don’t know how much longer I can keep up the act, but also don’t have a choice but to deal with it. i feel like I’ve been on the brink of a mental breakdown for over a decade, but my kids and wife gave me a reason to suffer through what previously were more dangerous thoughts. I can accept that and won’t give up like that even if only for them.

 I just wish i could remember the feeling when I was younger and thought those around me actually gave a shit about how I was doing. I get how that sounds, but can’t shake the feelings that I know it’s truth.

I used to be full of hope, optimism, idealism, passion…now I just feel empty. A machine only as good as it’s productivity who’s random cries for help are tolerated until it breaks once and for all and no longer is useful. 

I’m always tired. Always feel out of place. Always on a different wavelength. Always just a bit off. Always inadequate. Always feel separate, unsure, insecure. I’m just exhausted and feel out of places to turn.

I could be having a great day, it could be Friday, we got paid, we don’t work tomorrow. 
All circumstances are good. Nothing to really complain about. Yet sometimes I’ll just have this feeling and I know it’s coming.

I was asleep for 2 days when I woke up I remember the faces of my family. I was with my then girlfriend at the time and when I got through the baker act it felt like I had to restart for everyone so that i don’t hurt them again with my stupid actions. This was the second time I was baker acted for an attempt. The first time I was in 10th grade. The first time I had a thought about ending it I was around 8yrs old and I woke my dad up from sleep with a butter knife in hand and told him I didn’t want to be here anymore. I have scars that I’ve given myself years ago, recently I’ve started to cover some up with tattoos, but the pain still is there. I’ve hated myself for so long.


Well around August of last year it was the worst year for me, mentally it’s been exhausting. I broke up with my girlfriend, too much toxicity from the things she used to do and would do(mental and physical trauma). I thought I was the issue every time we fought, but she had a twitter where she would talk shit about me and talk about how she liked other guys. It hurt me a lot it killed my trust but it was my fault for finding it and betraying her privacy.. that’s what she told me. It hurts. That’s not fair. I finally hit the switch and broke it off after finding a better job that’s a 9-5, got out of customer service which I really needed.

During the time I broke up with her and started the new job I was messing with a  girl that got out of a similar situation. We had worked together at my old job, and always flirted but never did anything because knew it wasn’t good  for my relationship. Well when it ended we hit it off great. I mean she got out of a toxic relationship too, I knew it was going to be a rebound situation but we both needed it. She was amazing, I never knew how it felt to be treated by someone who actually cares about you. She showed me her scars and I showed her mine. Well she eventually told me that I caught feelings and she didn’t want that so she removed me from her life completely. Last time I saw her we kissed and I always look at the same spot in my driveway when I come home from work and the memories rush back. She left and never spoke to her again, last thing was a snap I sent saying “take care of yourself if you ever need me I’m here”

It’s almost been a year and since that occurrence and I’ve been to the hospital 3 times. The last time I was there I split open my knuckle from punching a mirror. I hate myself, id never hurt a soul but I hurt myself. I may not be able to use my hand the same, and it’s like I don’t even care.. my family is torn I could go on so much about how. Everyday I think about that girl how she treated me how it felt. But I don’t want to feel the pain of someone who doesn’t really care? Like not saying she didn’t but heartbreak sucks. And I don’t want to be in a situation where I feel controlled like I have to please every part of who I’m with. And finally… I just don’t want to be alone. I wake up go to work go home play games work out and go back to sleep to repeat. But i cry everyday I think about all this shit everyday. The games and the books are just minor distractions, they don’t even seem to work all the time. I hate crying and Im afraid of dying but what’s worse? A repeated loop? I mean everyday just feels the fucking same and I honestly hate it. Sure I can change it by adding another hobby? I mean I go out with friends but it feels like there’s just something not there, I hate this. I guess I’m just finally realizing how insignificant I am in the massive world filled with people making more by doing less or striving for a future filled with gold so they continue to pick up the scraps in hopes for a miracle.  

Right now I’ve settled on the fact that I’ll never see her again, never hold or speak to her. I’ll continue to live my life waiting for an opportunity to make good money to just live without the stress of waking up for the same routined shitty 9-5. I know I won’t love again or have someone because I’m clearly not in a good place and I don’t want to feel that pain again. I’ll die alone I know I will. I love my friends and family but I can’t burden them forever. They’ve been so good to me and I know it’s selfish but I’ve been so selfless maybe it’s time to be selfish. 

I’m sorry for the ramblings. It sounds crazy when I reread, it’s 2:38am and I have to wake up for work at 7:30. I just can’t stop thinking about how my life is a loop now, I know there’s gotta be ways to get out but right now I’m stuck. And I don’t know if I can continue. It’s been a hard life so far and this year just really blew up on me. I wish I could just leave this planet and look down to see how small everything really is compared to the spaces outside of our perspective. Falling in reverse.

Once school started back in person she kind of changed, she got friends and hung around guys. Our relationship wasn’t the same anymore. She kept “making mistakes” when it came to some guys and through screen sharing on FaceTime I found out she was telling other guys she misses them, putting hearts in their names, sending them hearts but then would tell me “I’m sorry I never meant to hurt you” but I’d told her multiple times to cut off the guys that obviously had feelings for her but she would always say “it’s hard because I’m a social person I like to have friends” Truth be told I don’t know if she lost interest or was trying to keep me around as some emotional support while she did me wrong. After awhile between my friends talking sense into me and me coming to the realization she wasn’t going to change I finally ended things with her, she kept trying to talk to me wanting to be friends but I couldn’t do it. Everytime I look at her all I see is pain and regret. She finally got the message and we haven’t spoke since July 15. The last couple times we spoke she told me that she has breakdowns, doesn’t talk to anyone anymore, the guys she was messing around with don’t talk to her anymore because I’m guessing she isn’t fun to them anymore now that she’s depressed.

I knew about these lies for a long time and I would just push it away but then it got close to us having to leave to move to New York for school and in her culture to go anywhere outside of her house with a man you must be married.

Mind you we are 22/23 we don’t have a lot of money saved up we are both college students and we are about to move to the most expensive city in the US. People around us are saying just move get married later and I agree with that and she does too but to and extent her family wants a grand wedding and they aren’t helping us at all so we have to figure all that out or don’t leave our small little town and another year goes by and we get set back in school and life. 

fast forward 4 months I get into my program in New York and I have to leave in a week, I tell her and her family this I say we have to go you already go into yours I just got into mine we have 6,000 saved and we have a place to stay we can do this. She’s iffy and I understand it’s a big move but the way our relationship was it was so strong this was a no brainer. We hav remade so many sacrifices for each other in every way! 

I ask her is there anything you need to tell me on why you don’t want to go ? 
She says she’s been lying to me about a lot of things and she’s afraid it will be revealed when we move and she will
Be stuck if I leave her. I tell her we can work on these things I know you’ve been lying I’ve prepared for this moment. We go back and fourth and realize it’s over 3 years of every day together hard times and good times VERY hard times and it’s over. I pack my stuff and leave. 

I drive 22 hours to New York and I’m putting on that fake persona again I have brothers and sisters but they are much older and Caribbean they don’t really understand. 

I’ve been taught to not show emotion never let anyone see you weak , my dad sided a few months ago and I want to cry but I haven’t shed a tear I haven’t even cried about this as  bad as I want to. 

All this bottled up turns to anger I get so mad so quickly. I know I made the right choice but I’m so sad and down and I’m tired of being fake I want people to know

A few things to get out of the way, this is a long distance relationship that is quite far.

We’re both minors with myself being 17 and him being 16.

With that out of the way, today has been a difficult evening as he confessed he’s harmed himself and is having trouble with his urges. This conversation continued with him explaining that he’s suicidal and doesn’t want my support and basically telling me he’s a burden and I should get rid of him. To the best of my abilities and in the heat of the moment I tried to tell him my stance and my experience with people in my life killing themselves and ultimately he explained how keeping people who’re mentally unwell alive is only making them more miserable, and he doesn’t blame me for holding onto hope.

It’s been 2 hours since things died down and he presumably went to bed. But honestly I’m not sure what to do but keep fighting as I know deep down inside if anything happens to him. I’ll never be the same.

They told me being employed would magically fix me so I threw myself into the workforce, thinking I could take the rainbow bridge to mental wellness and then I could be a novelist.

Was in a high-stress and decently-paying job for a few years. Bought my own placed and moved out. It was nice. The downside was that I couldn't write. When I was off from work I was too tired and braindead to do anything worthwhile. That's OK, I'll save up for a few more years and then take some time off for my passion. This fantasy kept me going.

Then was laid off. I had money set aside and could claim EDD. I rented out the house and moved back with my parents' for additional financial cushion. Everything was in place. Except. I couldn't write.

Everything I put on the paper is so dead and spiritless. If I picked a book off the shelf and found my own writing inside, I wouldn't make it past the first 5 pages. Drier and staler than cereal you forgot to seal and left in the cabinet. I look at my own writing from before - during HS, during college, during the worst of my depression, and it's clear I've lost whatever skill I had before. Now I am mediocre on a good day.

My parents are screaming at me to get a job. I do pay them rent, but it's not about the money. They are afraid if I remain unemployed, I will go back to being lazy and unmotivated (and eventually, broke).

I’m lost. I’m in the most pain I’ve ever felt in my life &amp; I know it might be pathetic putting my business on the internet like this but this is a last ditch effort to turn this shit around before I give up. 

I am a 25 year old male with a two year old son, currently mid divorce with his mother. A lustful spark killed by expectations and neglect on both parts. We tried to salvage the relationship and heal but things only got more aggressive as time passed. Our son was a surprise, and we welcomed him with so much love- but never stopped fighting no matter how many times we cried in each other’s arms for it to stop. 

While we were living at her parents house a few months back, in the heat of our fights- I found out she was on tinder &amp; was actively seeing somebody else. When I confronted her about it mid fight she was already so fed up of all our bs that she “didn’t have space” for me anymore &amp; kicked me out. Her family chose her side of course- and with me living and working with the family- my home &amp; job was instantly cut off. 

The truck that her father gave me for my first Father’s Day, *with the condition I keep it for my son when he’s older*, was taken back from me immediately as well. So now in the matter of days, I have no wife, no home, no car, no job. I reached out to my family and they gave me a lot of emotional support but couldn’t help in any physical way other than scouting for places in my area and sending them to me. 

While crashing at my friends house in town, I was able to use my prior work experience with my wife’s family to get a car from a dealership. I used 1k of the 2500 savings I had as a down payment. I found a place that’s $500 a month &amp; moved in. I’ve been Ubering/Lyft everyday to make sure I have enough gas money to visit my son &amp; pay my bills as I look for immediate jobs. With gas being so expensive and there not being a job market in my area- the more time passes the less resources I have. 

I haven’t been able to afford any of the payments on my vehicle since I got it- it’s a miracle I haven’t had the car repossessed yet and I’m terrified what’s going to happen if they take it back. My auto insurance is due Monday, so is my phone bill and rent, and I have literally $11 in my account. I don’t know what else I can do now. I’m literally finished. I tried to apply for a loan but because of my auto loan / work situation I’m not being accepted by any lenders. Tried donating plasma but my blood sugar isn’t high enough and they want me to come in after a full meal but I haven’t had a full meal in weeks. I downloaded nextdoor, Dave, Possible, Klover, etc all to get just a few more bucks for food or gas any time I can. 

I feel like every week I look at my routine and cut out as much finances as I can. I went from living with my son to seeing him once a week and doing video calls- which he is only getting less interested in - and that just kills me inside. This morning I had to give up my dog because I couldn’t take care of her anymore either. The only blessing I have right now is my friend that works at CiCis pizza has been boxing up leftovers for me after they close. Other than that- life is pretty pointless &amp; it’s only getting worse. 

I reached out to my family again and my mother has been able to find me a place to live if I can’t pay my rent this month, but that’s all the grace I’ve been given. I feel bent over- I feel like everything is being taken from me. I feel alone, duped, cheated and used. I feel lost mentally- unsafe and constantly in fear. I feel like I’m not even getting a chance to survie this. My soon to be ex wife just went on a leisure road trip to Tennessee with the family- while I’m pulling my hair out trying to get my basics covered. 


It breaks my heart the immaturity and disrespect we shared in the relationship, and I want nothing more than to change that in myself. In all my shitty ways- I see my responsibility in the downfall- and I also see the complete disregard and betrayal here. Everything changed so fast. I ignorantly put everything into this person, my heart, soul, money, life. And I left nothing to give to myself, literally nothing. I wish I wasn’t so young and dumb. I don’t even have the means to take care of my son now. To take care of myself. I don’t know what to do anymore.  I feel like just quitting this whole thing. No more texts, no more calls, no more disappointment. No more suffering. No more ubering for hours on an empty stomach. No more laying in bed wishing I could be held one more time. No more waking up sick to my stomach because my lunch and dinner was water the day prior. No more begging friends and family for help. No more fucking pain. I’m not sure how much of this anyone can take. This is cruel and i am not strong. Im not anything now. 

Thanks for listening- you’re probably the only one. Do me a favor, If you ever fall out with somebody- choose to love and support them still, even if there is no relationship left. Human decency and compassion need to exist. We all just want somebody to care- to show up for us.

I would describe depression as hell, when I experience depression lifting for a brief moment of time that is heaven to me.

I grew up with parents who were at times neglectful, at times overprotective (don't get me wrong, I still love them, and they love me too), and I was bullied at school for a few years. As a result, I became bitter and withdrew myself from any social activities. I finished a college degree on something I'm not quite satisfied with, and during that entire time I was nothing but a recluse who attended classes, studied and browsed the internet. I knew I was merely distracting myself, but I told myself I was happy, and I could deal with it. During the past year, due to a variety of circumstances, I took a long vacation with some of my extended family, and later got a part time job which I enjoyed. After these experiences, I discovered that what I always wanted was to live with people, make friends and share memories together. Not sitting all day in my room listening to music, reading or playing videogames. I managed to lie to myself for so long, but deep inside I always knew I had it in me. I was always told by my family and teachers that I was very outgoing and cheerful when I was a little kid, and that at some point I just seemed to become withdrawn. Looking back, I was actually pretty self-confident.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been thinking the past weeks about how my youth was a mistake. I gave everyone the cold shoulder. I hurt anyone who cared about me or dared to take interest in me. Today, I quite literally have no friends. I have never loved anyone beyond my own family, and have never been in a relationship. And as you could guess from the amount of ""I""s in this post, I've spent a good chunk of my life thinking only about myself. When I allow anxiety to take over me, things seem to go fine for a while but I feel awful, like a disaster waiting to happen, yet once I find things going fine and I start getting more confident, I eventually do or say something so stupid it just ruins everything, it's almost as if I know no other way to act, and I don't know if I was born like this or it's just because of how hurt I felt growing up.

&amp;#x200B;

Soon I'll be starting a pretty well-paying full-time job related to my degree and I have to ask myself what the hell is that money for, what will I stress myself for... who or what am I living for? I always turn down invitations, eventually stop treating people with respect and kindness, and nobody's ever going to love a person who's so emaciated, severely underweight and without their act together. I don't want to hurt anyone, but I always slip. And in terms of my immediate family, I love my parents, but I feel they just argue forever about some petty pointless thing or another, together we would never have fun, a few times I remember leaving, or crying, and never heard an apology from them or ask me what's wrong. There was a life out there that I skipped out of my own volition, and now I'll be trapped in relentless work with nothing to push me forward. And whenever I look in the mirror, I see someone who had so much potential, but what good is potential if you don't use it? There's little motivation left in me to improve. Almost thirty and I just wish I could go out and be a teen, but do it right this time. To bring the best out of people and go places with them, know each other, share a hobby, fall in love, dream big and actually feel like life is headed that way. But now I feel like I just want to die, I thought it would pass but its been days and the feeling is only becoming more intense. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm still hanging by a thread because there's a job to look forward to, but I know it'll be stressful and not what I wanted to live for, and no amount of money will make me happier. I was always told I should aim to earn a lot of money, and in my mind I always knew that's not true and not what I wanted, but life pushed me in this direction. I was told I'm smart, so I should study hard. Not a single soul in my life told me to go out and make friends, or encouraged me to do so. I should've known better, but ever since I withdrew from the world, I always did what I was told to do. I told my parents I should see a psychologist or get therapy but even when I went on the far end of explaining why, they didn't take me too seriously. Feelings got hurt, like I always do, but they seemed more upset with the discussion than concerned, and we didn't touch the matter anymore after that, but to be fair, I was harsh with them too, though harsh in the same way I am to myself. During some particular points of my life I had already played in my head with the idea of suicide or wanting to die, the first time around the time I had started gotten bullied at school. These days there are times I feel like I want to kill myself for real, I never got this far but I already know how I'd carry it out, but this is something I completely left out of my discussion with my parents and I don't know if I don't want to freak them out, or I'm afraid that even after telling them that, they won't take me too seriously. Because then I'll feel like I truly mean nothing. I know they'll probably care, but what if they don't? I don't want to go like that. Even the thought of inflicting this pain on them or my brother has left the equation by now. I'm completely disappointed in myself.

She has a job that she likes, but it’s with a fairly small company and hasn’t resulted in any sort of meaningful connections for her. 

She is in her mid twenties and desperately wants to get married and have a family someday, but she is losing confidence and hope. She has had some really, really bad past experiences with friends and relationships that I think have seriously damaged her confidence. She saw a therapist briefly, but it was not a good fit, and she has not had luck finding a new one.

I feel like I’m not doing enough, but I am also married and have a house and career and as awful as it sounds, it is exhausting trying to fill the void for her.

Last year I tried to end my life with a pill overdose, but failed and was diagnosed with MDD later. It was not easy getting better. But with the help of pills and psychotherapy, I no longer wish to kill myself all the time. But I feel empty. 

I've heard an excellent analogy to my current state: Imagine you lost your taste. Even if you eat your favorite meal, you don't feel the pleasure, because you can't taste it. So you stop caring about what you eat because it doesn't bring you anything. This goes for some time and then you stop eating altogether.

The things I used to enjoy are no longer enjoyable. So I spend most of my time in bed doing nothing. There is no reward for doing things. Even when I do something right, I don't feel anything.

It feels like my reward system is completely fucked. I wonder if I'll ever regain taste? That I will feel enjoyment from things again. Does anyone experienced/ is experiencing something similar?

I miss being a kid, not having to worry about anything. Just get up, go to school, and do whatever fun activities were planned for that day and then go home and enjoy the rest of the day with your family. Life was so simple and easy back then it's like that saying ""you don't know you were in the good old days until they're gone"" or something like that. I just wish I knew back then how good things were I would've done things so much differently.

School is another thing I miss greatly. As much of an outcast as i was in my grade and as much people couldn't care less if they noticed I was there or not for 12 years straight school was still such a fun time for me and I made such amazing memories and souvenirs there throughout the years. I met so many amazing teachers and had fun times that i wont forget. But now that I graduated highschool 2 months ago everything just died out.

I don't have anything to do most days, I usually just go out with my dad when I can but he works almost every day, I haven't talked to someone my age in almost 2 weeks, I never really had any friends to begin with, it just feels like such a dead end without having the same routine I've been doing for the past 12 years. 

I'm supposed to be starting community college next month cause my grades and gpa were too shit to get into an actual college but even that feels hopeless because I'm just not good at anything useful. The things that I am good at and I do like doing (video games, bird watching/bird photography, and drawing which I just started doing) can't really be turned into a reliable job so I just know I'm gonna go through all this for nothing and then be stuck with shitty low income jobs for the next 40 or 50 years just like my parents were and still are when they immigrated to the states.

I dont know man, I just cant really see me living a good future, it feels like I've already lived through all the good times ill have. I've thought about ending it quite a lot of times recently but I don't want to do it with my parents still alive. I can't put that kind of pain and suffering on them. They are the only ones I've had all these years when no one else cared.

So that's why I've decided to end it all once they pass. I can't imagine living in a world without them, especially my dad, so why bother? They're the only things keeping me going now, now that school is over. I never really wanted to grow old anyways, and I don't want to suffer through a sad and miserable future.

I wanted to be the kind of person that made everyone laugh, everyone trusted and relied on, all the girls liked, and was asked to go to all the different parties and events. For all of secondary school I ended up being pretty much the opposite of that. I'm chronically incompetent at everything due to what I'm guessing is undiagnosed ADHD, so I was always coming late to class, losing my books, and being called out by the teachers. I was also shit at basically every sport for the same reason and general godawful coordination. As a result I was laughed at by everyone, trusted and relied on by nobody, regarded with either pity or ridicule by every girl, and pretty much never invited to anything. Maybe my general awfulness at everything wasn't the sole reason for that. I was told often that if I didn't give bullies so much of a response, and if I didn't care so much about where I stood, I'd be more relaxed and likeable, but because instinctively, I wanted so badly to be popular, I found that impossible to do. I'd try to relax, but that's a contradiction in terms. I'd try not to give bullies a response, but my expression and body language always give me away.   


Once I started going to college, the situation evolved a bit. Nobody really bullies anybody in college, if someone doesn't like you, or thinks you're weird, they generally just leave and find someone else to talk to. There's over a thousand people in my college, so it's definitely not the same claustrophobic jungle as secondary school.  But that still doesn't change the underlying issue. I meet new people every day, and immerse myself in all range of clubs and activities, but no matter how much I put myself out there, I'm still stuck in the same situation. I'm ultimately fucking awful at everything, so I can't really get into hobbies, or meet people at clubs and events.  And as a result of the years of social isolation, I'm too weird to make casual connections with people at bars and parties and stuff. There's about a million occasions on which I met somebody, we swapped contacts and stuff, I invited them out to places, and then we never fucking spoke again. It's not even just a college thing either, I can't keep a fucking job because I'm so incompetent, let alone make friends at work.  


This has all led me to the situation I'm in today. Basically, all I really want in life is people's respect and approval, whether that's in romance, friendship, hobbies or work. I'm so fucking drowned in my inferiority complex I don't even know what I enjoy at this point. So long as it's with people who seem to approve of me, I'm fine with it, I don't have any actual preferences. So before people say I should just ""be myself"" or ""not worry about what other people think"", myself doesn't really exist. I'm essentially an aspirational human being, constantly in a state of trying to become another more likeable, popular person, except every single waking moment of my existence is a constant reminder of the fact that I won't be that person any time soon, and that I'm stuck as the fucking pathetic loser I've always been.  


As for practical solutions to do this, I'm currently going to therapy, but I've only just started, it's fortnightly which feels way too fucking infrequent to make any sizeable steps in the right direction any time soon, and I have no faith in my ability to ""talk it out"" and ""find a new perspective"" with someone considering I've been pretty much trying to do just that for the past ten years or so. I'm also looking to get ADHD medication so that I can be more competent, literally all of the waiting lists for psychiatrists which assess ADHD are closed in my country at the moment, so I'd have to wait about fucking two years before I can even hope to be good at anything. Finally, I've been getting into programming so that I can at least say I have a single skill which people can turn to me for, but it takes up pretty much all my time, and I'm still nowhere near a level which is considered good, so every fucking day is just basically dominated by me coding badly and desperately hoping that it will soon somehow lead to me being more respected.   


Overall the situation is pretty bleak, and to be honest, I don't know how much more of this life I can tolerate. If I can't be respected in life, or do anything that I enjoy, I feel like I might as well just top myself in some flashy way that gets people's attentions and makes them feel guilty for a couple of days before they move on with their lives.

""**1** Now the whole world had one language and a common speech. **2** As people moved eastward,\[[a](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+11&amp;version=NIV#fen-NIV-269a)\] they found a plain in Shinar\[[b](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+11&amp;version=NIV#fen-NIV-269b)\] and settled there.

**3** They said to each other, “Come, let’s make bricks and bake them thoroughly.” They used brick instead of stone, and tar for mortar. **4** Then they said, “Come, let us build ourselves a city, with a tower that reaches to the heavens, so that we may make a name for ourselves; otherwise we will be scattered over the face of the whole earth.”

**5** But the Lord came down to see the city and the tower the people were building. **6** The Lord said, “If as one people speaking the same language they have begun to do this, then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them. **7** Come, let us go down and confuse their language so they will not understand each other.”

**8** So the Lord scattered them from there over all the earth, and they stopped building the city. **9** That is why it was called Babel\[[c](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+11&amp;version=NIV#fen-NIV-276c)\]—because there the Lord confused the language of the whole world. From there the Lord scattered them over the face of the whole earth.""

&amp;#x200B;

The story made me think of my goals in life. And how I might be making my dreams to make a name for myself. But why I want to make a name for myself? Is it my ego? Am I being selfish? Or is it to have the name, so I can do great things for Him and also influence people to do the same?

I have seen two gastroenterologists, two rheumatologists, one infectious disease expert, two neurologists, one dermatologist, one optometrist and several blood tests and CT scans, MRI's, etc. I have seen so many different specialists because I have that many symptoms! It's ridiculous.

Just to give you a general overview of my symptoms: I am in pain in every single one of my joints (toes, back, knees, elbows, neck, everything), my muscles are weak and hurt as well. These are the main ones that hurt me. I have other symptoms like fatigue and dizziness, but that does not bother me at this point. I still manage to go out every once in a while but really not for long before my pain becomes really unbearable. I cannot work also.

I just came back from my appointment, and man am I mad and sad. The doctors think I may have Antisynthetase Syndrome. It is horrible, with a life expectancy of about five years. I am so scared right now. I have been depressed due to all the pain that I am in, but this new news just brought me down even more. I screamed in my car and cried my eyes out driving back home and hitting every object in front of me. It is so unfair. I have been nothing but good in my life and this is what happens to me. My doctors keep telling me to not give up but man it is tough when you still do not have a diagnosis after this long and your symptoms get worse. 

Now, this is based off one result from a blood test, and it is the first thing that they potentially found and are going to try to treat. They are going to put me on prednisone to see if it works.

Has anyone been in the same situation as me? Maybe it took you even more years and you were told that you may have a horrible disease but in the end it was not as large? Or maybe anybody has ways of coping with the pain or realization of what it could be? Anything that could lift me up would be great.

I can’t find my niche. I feel like everyone secretly hates me. Most times I’m ignored. And when I find someone decent I always end up some how ruining the relationship. This week has also been hard for me. Even when people are nice to me it’s like I forget about those good moments and focus on the negative and how much of a shitty person I am. 
Literally, music and art has kept me going. I’m sad though because I feel like I don’t get noticed that much by it. And I’ve been afraid to expand. I look on social media and people I know have thousands of friends and hundreds of likes and I have hardly anything. I start to think maybe my music is bad or my writing is bad. But I watched a video the other day about how not everything I do is going to be for everyone. 
It just makes me sad when people gravitate towards people I know. And they are just so cool and awesome but I’m like the third wheel. So even when people do show me attention I feel like I don’t deserve it. 
This past week has been super rough on me emotionally for a lot of reasons. But I also just feel really blah. I keep wondering if I’m ever going to get anywhere in life. I feel like I’m a late bloomer when it comes to a lot of things. And I’ve become more of a loner now. I used to have more friends when I was a kid but then I started to believe that I was not good enough. I got bullied really bad also. Kind of an unstable home life. It’s just been hard. I hate nagging. But im glad this exists so that I can talk about it to people who may actually want to listen most people just turn their back.

What helps me through this is thinking of things I love and imagining not being able to do that again. I love singing and making music, writing poems and stories. I appreciate my art. And it gives me joy. Thinking of not seeing the worlds beauty again helps me appreciate my life and the things I have yet to explore.

I have heard it, smelled it, tasted it, and I sit here wondering what the appeal is. So much of the world I've seen results in death. So much suffering. Those that are privledged, last unabridged. Those with consciences are left paralyzed and powerless. Those, pathological and without remose, exceed. Forever revered and absent of the ""ends"" and the  ""means"" and the true ""substance"" of it all.

 If the substantive matter of death wasn't so lackluster, if humans weren't just flesh, and bones, and bile, suicide might be the optimal option. But we ARE just flesh, and bones, and bile. Masses of tissue and fat, ligaments torn and forever useless unless corrected by the privledge of the excess obscenities of the few. 

What righteous value is left? I don't believe in brotherhood, religion, love, or more recently myself. I will always attest the truth--my parents and family have been the shining, unwavering beacon in my life. But here I am in the dark and their light only shines so far. It's so dark I don't know how the common man has persevered, if not the carnal desire to defy.

Defy heartbreak, defy reason at times, defy the conceived power over others. Defiance of comfort has to be the single uniting factor of good men across cultures. Lacking the luxuries all while staring into the unforgiving abyss, lost, doubting, bald and unclothed. 

Nothing in my upbringing could have prepared me for such a close betrayal. Time and time again, my trust was replaced by her selfishness. I was by no means perfect in my owns means, but I can adamantly state I was true in my thoughts, desires, and ambitions. I would have held her for the rest of my life through thick and thin. 

Betrayed. Sullen. Loathing for the lost. I can't bring myself to love anyone else than her, so I turn towards the uncomfortable. The Necessary Suffering. The unknown, unfortunate, unyielding, and fouled. Forever set against simple truth thus searing my satience.

It is not. I thought I could help people, but I can't. I couldn't help my friend, I will certainly not be able to help strangers. I really thought I was gonna make a difference in someone's life. I had a wish for being recognized by my efforts, but maybe I did no effort after all.

I think my friend is dead. It's been some time he does not answer anyone. All our mutual friends can't reach him. The worse: he usually did this kind of stuff. He would always post something sad, or how he's going crazy, or how everything was falling apart. He would say he's close to attempting something. He never did. He was a good person. I never knew him personally, but we've been friends for years. I watched all his Punch-Out gameplay videos. We started talking about anime, yet soon we were discussing our lives. He made this insane persona where he used a wool cap over his whole face and would be the crazy in him. He said it could be my Stand (as in JoJo's stands). He was my partner and I am so worried. I thought he was past his darkest days, he got a girl who meant a lot for him. He wasn't fighting as often with his drunk dad. 

But I remember him telling me someday his dad came home agressive, and loud. He told him to get out of the house, which he said he would. But then ensues arguing, and the dad breaks a chair and proceed to get a leg to hit my friend. He then gets a iron rod to defend himself. At this point the dad tries to go after his mother, and he responds by hitting his dad with the rod. The insane dad then grabs a knife. Luckily my friend managed to hit his hand and get a hold of the knife. He ended up having to sleep with a friend. I wish I was this friend. I wish I got to see him at least once before I left him to rot on that country. 

If he's really dead, how could I know? I don't have his parents numbers, he wasn't close with anyone in his city and even if he were, I don't have their number. He was quite really the only person who would compliment me. He was the only person who ever said they thought I was beautiful besides my girlfriend. He was someone who undestood me when no one else could. And I feel I failed this friend. I should have been better.

How can I know I am not missing his funeral? I can only hope he didn't succeeded in his plans. The last I heard of him was a post about how we would never hear from him anymore. I messaged him right after seeing that. He never got my texts. I regret not being a better friend. I regret sometimes giving him short replies or none at all. I regret not asking about him daily. I just wish I could know how his day is going. I just wanna get a message saying the word he used when he changed numbers. Just that word would be enough.

Am I asking too much? To know my friend is alright? To know I have not failed him... I am heartbroken, and I somehow escaped this ordeal the last weeks. I managed to keepyself distracted. I thought to myself, ""anyday now he'll message from a new number"". But it's been 2 months now. 

Sogeking, you shared your cigarettes, your troubles, your life with me. I am sorry I failed you so much. I wish I insisted on hearing you, on giving crappy advice.
